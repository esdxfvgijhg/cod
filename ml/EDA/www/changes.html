This page documents changes made to the online version of
the Handbook.
<p>
The initial publication of the CD of the Handbook was generated
from the 6/2003 version.  We do not document changes made before
this date.
<p>
Subsequent printings of the CD will incorporate changes documented
here.  We will list print dates for the CD.  If your copy of
the Handbook CD does not contain a print date, then it
is from the initial 6/2003 printing.

The following changes were made in November, 2016.
<ol>
   <li>On all pages, the javascript code to collect usage
       statistics was modifed.  This should have no effect on the
       content of the pages.
       <p>
   <li>The method for exit scripts (i.e., for links that leave the
       NIST web pages) was modified to use JavaScript code (the
       CGI script that was previously used is no longer available).
       This should have no effect on the content of the pages.
       <p>
       Cerain pages use "frames".  The JavaScript exit code for these
       pages is incompatible with some of the frame code (i.e., we
       can have either the exit script or correct navigation back to
       the e-Handbook page, but currently not both).  The exit script
       code was removed on these pages.
       <p>
       The new exit script code to the Sematech page in the navigation
       bar does not currently work.  Therefore the exit script code was
       removed.
       <p>
   <li>The acknowledgements page was updated to remove dead links and
       to correct the links to NIST pages to reflect the new Drupal content
       management system.

   <li>In a number of case studies in the EDA chapter, the report
       for the test of normality stated that the test was based on
       the Anderson-Darling test.  It was in fact based on the PPCC
       test.  The fix was to augment the report to include both the
       PPCC and the Anderson-Darling tests.

       The Dataplot macros for the distributional tests were also
       updated.  Note also that Dataplot changed the way

The following changes were made in November, 2013.
<ol>
   <li>Equations in the e-Handbook are currently rendered as
       GIF files (these were originally created using either
       LaTex or Word.  We are currently replacing these with
       MathJax.  MathJax uses JavaScript to render inline
       LaTex equations.  Chapters 1 and 2 have now been updated
       on the public site.  Related to this, most stand alone
       occurrences of Greek characters are now rendered using
       HTML syntax (e.g., &alpha;) rather than as GIF files
       (GIF files were used in the original e-Handbook pages
       due to the fact that some of the popular browsers did
       not yet support the HTML Greek characters).  Again,
       this conversion is completed for Chapters 1 and 2.
       Some minor editiorial updates were made to Chapter 1.
       <p>
   <li>A small bit of JavaScript code has been added to all of
       the HTML pages.  This JavaScript code is being used by
       NIST to genrate web page usage statistics for NIST.
       It involves no substantive change in the e-Handbook.
       <p>
   <li>On page prc312, corrected the formula for the unpaired
       observations, unequal variances case.
       <p>
   <li>On page pmc42, there was an error in computing the mean
       for the net income example.  This error propogated to the
       other values in the table and to the final MSE.  Corrected
       the mean value, the error and squared error columns, and
       the final MSE.
       <p>
   <li>Created a directory, Rcode, to contain the R codes and
       associated data files used in the e-Handbook.  Under
       Tools & Aids page there is a link to "Statistical Software".
       This page (dataplot.htm) contains a link to the R web site.
       In this section, I added a link to a zip file that contains
       the contents of the Rcode directory.
       <p>
   <li>Fixed a typo in an equation (changed 2*SQRT(16) to 3*SQRT(16)).
       <p>
   <li>On page pmc324, fixed some typos in the "EWMA statistics" table

The following changes were made in July, 2004.
<ol>
   <li>The example on page mpc3321.htm (section 3 of the MPC chapter)
       had an error in the A inverse matrix.  This error propogated
       throughout the remaining computations on the page.  Therefore
       significant edits were made to the example.  In addition,
       some editorial corrections were made to the page.
       <P>
   <li>Page pri3347.htm links to a number of files containing
       various designs.  The file containing the 2<sup>8-3</sup>
       design was incorrect and was replaced with the correct
       design.  The resolution listed in the file containing the
       2<sup>7-3</sup> was incorrect and was replaced with the
       correct resolution.  The link to the 2<sup>8-1</sup> design
       listed the wrong resolution (the resolution given in the
       file was correct) and was corrected.

       mpc372a.gif, and mpc372b.gif seem to have corrupted for
       some unknown reason.  This was causing some werid formatting
       in some of the probability distribution tables.  Good copies
       of these gif files were restored.

        in it."
       <P>
   <li>Page pmd452.htm (section 4 of the PMD chapter) 
       had four missing equation files. The missing files,

       Added links to both installation documentation and usage
       documentation for the Course Builder.
       <p>
       Note that the Course Builder is not active on the NIST

   <li>In section 5 of the MPC chapter, page mpc55.htm had a
       typo in a link.  This was corrected.

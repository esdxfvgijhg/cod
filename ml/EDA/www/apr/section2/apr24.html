<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="15%"><!-- Add marginal notes below --><i>Choosing
a good acceleration model is part science and part art - but start with
a good literature search</i></td>

<td WIDTH="85%"><!-- Add main text below -->
<p>Choosing a physical acceleration model is a lot like choosing a life
distribution model. First identify the failure mode and what stresses are
relevant (i.e., will accelerate the failure mechanism). Then check to see
if the literature contains examples of successful applications of a particular
model for this mechanism.&nbsp;
<p>If the literature offers little help, try the models described in earlier
sections :&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
<a href="../section1/apr151.html">Arrhenius</a></li>

<li>
<a href="../section1/apr153.html#The (Inverse) Power Rule for">The (inverse)
power rule for voltage</a></li>

<li>
<a href="../section1/apr153.html#The Exponential Voltage">The exponential
voltage model</a></li>

<li>
<a href="../section1/apr153.html#Two Temperature/Voltage">Two temperature/voltage
models</a></li>

<li>
<a href="../section1/apr153.html#The Electromigration">The electromigration
model</a></li>

<li>
<a href="../section1/apr153.html#Three Stress Models (Temperature, Voltage and">Three
stress models (temperature, voltage and humidity)</a></li>

<li>
<a href="../section1/apr152.html">Eyring (</a>for more than three stresses
or when the above&nbsp; models are not satisfactory)</li>

<li>
<a href="../section1/apr153.html#The Coffin-Manson Mechanical Crack Fatigue">The
Coffin-Manson mechanical crack growth model</a></li>
</ul>
All but the last model (the Coffin-Manson) apply to chemical or electronic
failure mechanisms, and since temperature is almost always a relevant stress
for these mechanisms, the Arrhenius model is nearly always a part of any
more general model. The Coffin-Manson model works well for many mechanical
fatigue-related mechanisms.&nbsp;
<p>
Sometimes models have to be adjusted to include a <b>threshold level</b>
for some stresses. In other words, failure might never occur due to a particular
mechanism unless a particular stress (temperature, for example) is beyond
a threshold value. A model for a temperature-dependent mechanism with a
threshold at \(T = T_0\)
<!-- <i>T = T<sub>0</sub></i> -->
might look like&nbsp;

$$ \mbox{time to fail } = \frac{f(T)}{T - T_0} \, , $$

<!--
<blockquote>time to fail = <i>f(T)/(T-T<sub>0</sub>)</i></blockquote>
<p>
<br>
-->

for which \(f(T)\)
<!-- <i>f(T)</i> -->
could be Arrhenius. As the temperature decreases towards \(T_0\),
<!-- <i>T<sub>0</sub></i>, --> 
time to fail increases toward infinity in
this (deterministic) acceleration model.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="15%"><i>Models derived theoretically have been very
successful and are convincing</i></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="85%">In some cases, a mathematical/physical description
of the failure mechanism can lead to an acceleration model. Some of the
models above were originally derived that way.</td>

<tr>
<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="15%"><i>Simple models are often the best</i></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="85%">In general, use the simplest model (fewest parameters)
you can. When you have chosen a model, use visual tests and formal statistical
fit tests to confirm the model is consistent with your data. Continue to
use the model as long as it gives results that "work," but be quick to
look for a new model when it is clear the old one is no longer adequate.
<p>There are some good quotes that apply here:</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="15%"><i>Quotes from experts on models</i></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="85%">"All models are wrong, but some are useful."
- George Box, and the principle of <i>Occam's Razor</i> (attributed to
the 14th century logician William of Occam who said “Entities should not
be multiplied unnecessarily” - or something equivalent to that in Latin).&nbsp;
<p>A modern version of Occam's Razor is: If you have two theories that
both explain the observed facts then you should use the simplest one until
more evidence comes along - also called the <b>Law of Parsimony</b>.&nbsp;
<p>Finally, for those who feel the above quotes place too much emphasis
on simplicity, there are several appropriate quotes from Albert Einstein:&nbsp;
<blockquote>"Make your theory as simple as possible, but no simpler."
<p>"For every complex question there is a simple and wrong solution."</blockquote>

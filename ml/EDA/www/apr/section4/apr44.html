methods for comparing reliability between populations are described</i></td>

<td WIDTH="85%"><!-- Add main text below -->
<p>Comparing reliability among populations based on samples of failure
data usually means asking whether the samples came from populations with
the same reliability function (or CDF). Three techniques already described
can be used to answer this question for censored reliability data. These
are:&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
<a href="#Comparing Sample Proportion Fails">Comparing sample proportion
failures</a>&nbsp;</li>

<li>
<a href="#Likelihood Ratio Test">Likelihood ratio test comparisons</a></li>

<li>
<a href="#Lifetime Regression">Lifetime regression comparisons</a></li>
</ul>
<a NAME="Comparing Sample Proportion Fails"></a><b>Comparing Sample Proportion
Failures</b>
<p>Assume each sample is a random sample from possibly a different lot,
vendor or production plant. All the samples are tested under the same conditions.
Each has an observed proportion of failures on test. Call these sample
proportions of failures \(p_1, \, p_2, \, p_3, \, \ldots, \, p_n\).
<!-- <i>p<sub>1</sub>, p<sub>2</sub>, p<sub>3</sub>,...p<sub>n</sub></i>. -->
Could these all have come from equivalent populations?&nbsp;
<p>This is a question covered in Chapter 7 <a href="../../prc/section3/prc33.html">for
two populations,</a> and for <a href="../../prc/section4/prc46.html">more
than two populations,</a> and the techniques described there apply equally
well here.&nbsp;
<p>
<a NAME="Likelihood Ratio Test"></a><b>Likelihood Ratio Test Comparisons</b>
<p>
The <a href="../section2/apr233.html">Likelihood Ratio test</a> was described
earlier. In this application, the Likelihood ratio \(\lambda\)
<!-- &nbsp;<img SRC="gifs/lambda.gif" ALT="lambda"  align=ABSBOTTOM> -->
has as a denominator the product of all the Likelihoods of all the samples
assuming each population has its own unique set of parameters. The numerator
is the product of the Likelihoods assuming the parameters are exactly the
same for each population. The test looks at whether \(-2\mbox{ ln } \lambda\)
<!-- -2ln<img SRC="gifs/lambda.gif" ALT="lambda"  align=ABSBOTTOM> -->
is unusually large, in which case it is unlikely the populations have the
same parameters (or reliability functions).&nbsp;
<p>This procedure is very effective if, and only if, it is built into the
analysis software package being used and this software covers the models
and situations of interest to the analyst.&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="Lifetime Regression"></a><b>Lifetime Regression Comparisons</b>
<p>Lifetime regression is similar to <a href="apr422.html">maximum
likelihood</a> and <a href="../section2/apr233.html">likelihood ratio test
methods.</a> Each sample is assumed to have come from a population with
the same shape parameter and a wide range of questions about the scale
parameter (which is often assumed to be a "measure" of lot-to-lot or vendor-to-vendor
quality) can be formulated and tested for significance.&nbsp;
<p>For a complicated, but realistic example, assume a company manufactures
memory chips and can use chips with some known defects ("partial goods")
in many applications. However, there is a question of whether the reliability
of "partial good" chips is equivalent to "all good" chips. There exists
lots of customer reliability data to answer this question. However the
data are difficult to analyze because they contain several different vintages
with known reliability differences as well as chips manufactured at many
different locations. How can the partial good vs all good question be resolved?&nbsp;
<p>A lifetime regression model can be constructed with variables included
that change the scale parameter based on vintage, location, partial versus
all good, and any other relevant variables. Then, a good lifetime regression
program will sort out which, if any, of these factors are significant and,
in particular, whether there is a significant difference between "partial
good" and "all good".&nbsp;</td>

<I>Scatter Plots Allow Comparison of Random Variation Across Data</I>

Similar to their use in checking the sufficiency of the functional form of 
the model, <A HREF="../../eda/section3/scatterp.html">scatter plots</A> of 
the residuals are also used to check the <A HREF="../section2/pmd213.html">
assumption of constant standard deviation of random errors</A>.  Scatter plots
of the residuals versus the explanatory variables and versus the predicted
values from the model allow comparison of the amount of random variation in
different parts of the data.  For example, the plot below shows residuals 
from a straight-line fit to the <A HREF="../section1/pmd11.html#pt.r1">
Pressure/Temperature data</A>.  In this plot the range of the residuals looks
essentially constant across the levels of the predictor variable, temperature.  
The scatter in the residuals at temperatures between 20 and 30 degrees is 
similar to the scatter in the residuals between 40 and 50 degrees and between
55 and 70 degrees.  This suggests that the standard deviation of the random 
errors is the same for the responses observed at each temperature.

To illustrate how the residuals from the Pressure/Temperature data would look
if the standard deviation was not constant across the different temperature
levels, a modified version of the data was simulated.  In the modified version,
the standard deviation increases with increasing values of 
pressure.  Situations like this, in which the standard deviation increases with
increasing values of the response, are among the most common ways that 
non-constant random variation occurs in physical science and engineering
applications.  A plot of the data is shown below.

<I>Residuals Indicate Non-Constant Standard Deviation</I>

The residual plot from a straight-line fit to the modified data, however,
highlights the non-constant standard deviation in the data.  The horn-shaped
residual plot, starting with residuals close together around 20 degrees and 
spreading out more widely as the temperature (and the pressure) increases, is
a typical plot indicating that the assumptions of the analysis are not
satisfied with this model.  Other residual plot shapes besides the
horn shape could indicate non-constant standard deviation as well.  For
example, if the response variable for a data set peaked in the middle of the
range of the predictors and was small for extreme values of the predictors,
the residuals plotted versus the predictors would look like two horns with
the bells facing one another.  In a case like this, a plot of the residuals
versus the predicted values would exhibit the single horn shape, however.

<TD WIDTH=85%>
The use of residual plots to check the assumption of constant standard
deviation works in the same way for most modeling methods.  It is not limited
to least squares regression even though that is almost always the context in
which it is explained.  The plot below shows the residuals from a LOESS fit to
the data from the <A HREF="../section1/pmd132.html#tc.r1">Thermocouple
Calibration example</A>.  The even spread of the residuals across the range of
the data does not indicate any changes in the standard deviation, leading us
to the conclusion that this assumption is not unreasonable for these data.

<I>Correct Function Needed to Check for Constant Standard Deviation</I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%>
One potential pitfall in using residual plots to check for constant standard
deviation across the data is that the functional part of the model must
adequately describe the systematic variation in the data.  If that is not 
the case, then the typical horn shape
observed in the residuals could be due to an artifact of the  function fit to
the data rather than to non-constant variation.  For example, in the 
<A HREF="pmd422.html#pr.r1">Polymer Relaxation example</A> it was hypothesized 
that both time and temperature are related to the response variable, torque.  
However, if a single stretched exponential model in time was the initial model
used for the process, the residual plots could be misinterpreted fairly easily,
leading to the false conclusion that the standard deviation is not constant across
the data.  When the functional part of the model does not fit the data well, the
residuals do not reflect purely random variations in the process.  Instead, they
reflect the remaining structure in the data not accounted for by the function.
Because the residuals are not random, they cannot be used to answer questions
about the random part of the model.
This also emphasizes the importance of plotting the data before fitting the
initial model, even if a theoretical model for the data is available.
<A HREF="pmd422.html#dmhd">Looking at the data before fitting the initial model</A>,
at least in this case, would likely forestall this potential problem.

<TD WIDTH=85%>
Fortunately, even if the initial model were incorrect, and the residual plot
above was made, there are clues in this plot that indicate that the horn
shape (pointing left this time) is not caused by non-constant standard
deviation.  The cluster of residuals at time zero that have a residual
torque near one indicate that the functional part of the model does not fit
the data.  In addition, even when the residuals occur with equal frequency above
and below zero, the spacing of the residuals at each time does not really look
random.  The spacing is too regular to represent random measurement errors.
At measurement times near the low end of the scale, the spacing of the points
increases as the residuals decrease and at the upper end of the scale the
spacing decreases as the residuals decrease.  The patterns in the spacing of
the  residuals also points to the fact that the functional form of the model is
not correct and needs to be corrected before drawing conclusions about the
distribution of the residuals.

Model validation is possibly the most important step in the model building
sequence.  It is also one of the most overlooked.  Often the validation of
a model seems to consist of nothing more than quoting the \(R^2\)
<!-- <IMG ALT="R^2" SRC="eqns/R2.gif"> -->
statistic from the fit (which measures the fraction
of the total variability in the response that is accounted for by the model).  
Unfortunately, a high \(R^2\)
<!--<IMG ALT="R^2" SRC="eqns/R2.gif"> -->
value does not guarantee
that the model fits the data well.  Use of a model that does not fit the 
data well cannot provide good answers to the underlying engineering or
scientific questions under investigation.

<I>Main Tool: Graphical Residual Analysis</I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%>
There are many statistical tools for model validation, but the primary tool
for most process modeling applications is graphical residual analysis.  
Different types of plots of the residuals <A HREF="#resdef">(see definition
below)</A> from a fitted
model provide information on the adequacy of different aspects of the model.  
Numerical methods for model validation, such as the \(R^2\)
<!-- <IMG ALT="R^2" SRC="eqns/R2.gif"> -->
statistic, are also useful, but usually to a lesser degree than graphical
methods.  Graphical methods have an advantage over numerical methods for 
model validation because they readily illustrate a broad range of complex
aspects of the relationship between the model and the data.  Numerical methods
for model validation tend to be narrowly focused on a particular aspect of the
relationship between the model and the data and often try to compress that 
information into a single descriptive number or test result.

<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top>
<I>Numerical Methods' Forte</I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%>
Numerical methods do play an important role as confirmatory methods for 
graphical techniques, however.  For example, the 
<A HREF="pmd442.html">lack-of-fit test</A> 
for assessing the correctness of the functional part of the model can aid in 
interpreting a borderline residual plot.  There are also a few 
modeling situations in which graphical methods cannot easily be used.  In
these cases, numerical methods provide a fallback position for model
validation.  One common situation when numerical validation methods take
precedence over graphical methods is when the number of parameters being
estimated is relatively close to the size of the data set.  In this situation
residual plots are often difficult to interpret due to constraints on the
residuals imposed by the estimation of the unknown parameters.  One area 
in which this typically happens is in optimization applications using designed
experiments.  Logistic regression with binary data is another area in which
graphical residual analysis can be difficult.

The residuals from a fitted model are the differences between the responses
observed at each combination values of the explanatory variables and the corresponding
prediction of the response computed using the regression function.
Mathematically, the definition of the residual for the <I>i<SUP>th</SUP></I>
observation in the data set is written

$$ e_i = y_i - f(\vec{x}_i;\hat{\vec{\beta}}) $$

<!-- <BR><BR><CENTER><IMG ALT=" e_i = y_i - f(\vec{x}_i;\vec{\hat{\beta}})"

The data listed below are from the

in <A HREF="../section1/pmd11.html">Section 4.1.1.</A>   The first column 
shows the order in which the observations were made, the second column indicates the
day on which each observation was made, and the third column gives the ambient 
temperature recorded when each measurement was made. The fourth column lists the 
temperature of the gas itself (the explanatory variable) and the fifth column 
contains the observed pressure of the gas (the response variable).  Finally, the sixth
column gives the corresponding values from the fitted straight-line regression function.

$$ \hat{P} = 7.749695 + 3.930123T $$

<I>Why Use Residuals?</I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%>
If the model fit to the data were  correct, the residuals would approximate the 
random errors that make the relationship between the explanatory variables and
the response variable a <A HREF="../section1/pmd12.html#srlshp">statistical
relationship</A>.  Therefore, if the residuals appear to behave randomly, it
suggests that the model fits the data well.  On the other hand, if non-random
structure is evident in the residuals, it is a clear sign that the model fits
the data poorly.  The subsections listed below detail the types of plots to use
to test different aspects of a model and give guidance on the correct
interpretations of different results that could be observed for each type of
plot.

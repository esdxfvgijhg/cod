<A HREF="../../eda/section3/eda33p.html">"Run order" or "run sequence" plots</A> of
the residuals are used to check for drift in the process.  The run order residual plot is
a special type of scatter plot in which each residual is plotted versus an index that
indicates the order (in time) in which the data were collected. This plot is useful,
however, only if data have been collected in a randomized run order, or some other order that
is not increasing or decreasing in any of the predictor variables used in the model. If
the data have been collected in a time order that is increasing or decreasing with the 
predictor variables, then any drift in the process may not be able to be separated from
the functional relationship between the predictors and the response. This is why 
randomization is emphasized in <A HREF="../section3/pmd33.html#rnd.r1">experiment design</A>.

Taken as a whole, this plot essentially shows 
that there is only random scatter in the relationship between the observed pressures and 
order in which the data were collected, rather than any systematic relationship. Although
there appears to be a slight trend in the residuals when plotted in run order, the trend 
is small when measured against short-term random variation in the data, indicating that 
it is probably not a real effect. The presence of this apparent trend does emphasize, however, 
that practice and judgment are needed to correctly interpret these plots. Although 
residual plots are a very useful tool, if critical judgment is not used in their 
interpretation, you can see things that aren't there or miss things that are. One hint
that the slight slope visible in the data is not worrisome in this case is the fact that
the residuals overlap zero across all runs. If the process was drifting significantly,
it is likely that there would be some parts of the run sequence in which the 
residuals would not overlap zero. If there is still some doubt about the slight trend 
visible in the data after using this graphical procedure, a term describing the drift 
can be added to the model and tested numerically to see if it has a significant impact 
on the results.

</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%>
To illustrate how the residuals from the Pressure/Temperature data would look
if there were drift in the process, a modified version of the data was simulated.  
A small drift of 0.3 units/measurement was added to the process.  A plot of the 
data is shown below. In this run sequence plot a clear, strong trend is visible
and there are portions of the run order where the residuals do not overlap zero.
Because the structure is so evident in this case, it is easy to conclude that 
some sort of drift is present. Then, of course, its cause needs to be determined
so that appropriate steps can be taken to eliminate the drift from the process or
to account for it in the model.

As in the case when the standard deviation was not constant across the data set, 
<!-- DEP --><A HREF="dep/dep443b.html">comparison</A> of these two versions
of the data is interesting because the drift is not apparent in either data set
when viewed in the scale of the data. This highlights the need for graphical 
residual analysis when developing process models.

The run sequence plot, like most types of residual plots, can be used to check 
for drift in many regression methods.  It is not limited to least squares fitting 
or one particular type of model. The run sequence plot below shows the residuals 
from the fit of the nonlinear model 

$$ y = \beta_0 + \beta_1\exp\left[-\left(\frac{x_1}{\beta_2+\beta_4x_2+\beta_5x_2^2}\right)^{\beta_3}\right] + \varepsilon $$

to the data from the <A HREF="pmd422.html#pr.r1">Polymer Relaxation example</A>.  
The even spread of the residuals across the range of the data indicates that 
there is no apparent drift in this process.

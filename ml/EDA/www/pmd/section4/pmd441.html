<A HREF="../../eda/section3/scatterp.html">Scatter plots</A> of the residuals 
versus the predictor variables in the model and versus potential predictors that are not included
in the model are the primary plots used to assess sufficiency of the functional
part of the model.  Plots in which the residuals do not exhibit any systematic
structure indicate that the model fits the data well.  Plots of the residuals
versus other predictor variables, or potential predictors, that exhibit
systematic structure indicate that the form of the function can be improved in 
some way.

The residual scatter plot below, of the residuals from a straight line fit
to the Pressure/Temperature data introduced in 
<A HREF="../section1/pmd11.html#pt.r1">Section 4.1.1.</A> and also discussed
in the <A HREF="pmd44.html#pt.r2">previous section</A>, does not indicate
any problems with the model.  The reference line at 0 emphasizes that the 
residuals are split about 50-50 between positive and negative.  There are no
systematic patterns apparent in this plot.  Of course, just as the <I>R</I><sup>2</sup>

statistic cannot justify a particular model on its own,
no single residual plot can completely justify the adoption of a particular
model either.  If a plot of these residuals versus another variable did show
systematic structure, the form of model with respect to that variable would 
need to be changed or that variable, if not in the model, would need to be 
added to the model.  It is important to plot the residuals versus every 
available variable to ensure that a candidate model is the best model possible.

<I>Importance of Environmental Variables</I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%>
One important class of potential predictor variables that is often overlooked is
environmental variables.  Environmental variables include things like ambient
temperature in the area where measurements are being made and ambient humidity.
In most cases environmental variables are not expected to have any noticeable
effect on the process, but it is always good practice to check for unanticipated
problems caused by environmental conditions.
Sometimes the catch-all environmental variables can also be used to assess the
validity of a model.  For example, if an experiment is run over several days,
a plot of the residuals versus day can be used to check for differences in the
experimental conditions at different times.  Any differences observed will not
necessarily be attributable to a specific cause, but could justify further
experiments to try to identify factors missing from the model, or other model
misspecifications.  The two residual plots below show the pressure/temperature
residuals versus ambient lab temperature and day.  In both cases the plots 
provide further evidence that the straight line model gives an adequate
description of the data.  The plot of the residuals versus day does look a
little suspicious with a slight cyclic pattern between days, but doesn't indicate
any overwhelming problems.  It is likely that this apparent difference between days
is just due to the random variation in the data.

<I>Residual Scatter Plots Work Well for All Methods</I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%>
The examples of residual plots given above are for the simplest possible case,
straight line regression via least squares, but the residual plots are
used in exactly the same way for almost all of the other statistical methods 
used for model building.  For example, the residual plot below is for the 
LOESS model fit to the thermocouple calibration data introduced in 
<A HREF="../section1/pmd132.html#tc.ex">Section 4.1.3.2</A>.  Like the plots
above, this plot does not signal any problems with the fit of the LOESS model
to the data.  The residuals are scattered both above and below the reference  line
at all temperatures.  Residuals adjacent to one another in the plot do not tend
to have similar signs.  There are no obvious systematic patterns of any type in
this plot.

<I>An Alternative to the LOESS Model</I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%>
Based on the <A HREF="../section1/pmd132.html#tc.ms.plt">plot</A> of voltage 
(response) versus the temperature (predictor) for the thermocouple calibration
data, a quadratic model would have been a reasonable initial model for these data.
The quadratic model is the simplest possible model that could account for the
curvature in the data.  The scatter plot of the residuals versus temperature
for a quadratic model fit to the data clearly indicates that it is a poor fit,
however.  This residual plot shows strong cyclic structure in the residuals.  If
the quadratic model did fit the data, then this structure would not be left
behind in the residuals.  One thing to note in comparing the residual plots for
the quadratic and LOESS models, besides the amount of structure remaining in the
data in each case, is the difference in the scales of the two plots.  The 
residuals from the quadratic model have a range that is approximately fifty times
the range of the LOESS residuals.

<I>Extension of Linear Least Squares Regression</I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%>
Nonlinear least squares regression extends linear least squares 
regression for use with a much larger and more general class of functions.
Almost any function that can be written in closed form can be 
incorporated in a  nonlinear regression model.  Unlike linear regression,
there are very few limitations on the way parameters can be used in the 
functional part of a nonlinear regression model.  The way in which the 
unknown parameters in the function are estimated, however, is conceptually
the same as it is in linear least squares regression.

As the name suggests, a nonlinear model is any model of the

$$ y = f(\vec{x};\vec{\beta}) + \varepsilon \, ,$$

<!-- <BR><BR><CENTER><IMG ALT="

in which
<OL> 
<LI>the functional part of the model is <I>not 
<A HREF="pmd141.html#def">linear</A></I> with respect 
to the unknown parameters, \(\beta_0, \, \beta_1, \, \ldots \, \),
<!-- <IMG ALT="\beta_0, \beta_1, \ldots" ALIGN=absmiddle SRC="eqns/blist.gif">, -->
and

Due to the way in which the unknown parameters of the function are
usually estimated, however, it is often much easier to work with models
that meet two additional criteria:
<OL> 
<LI VALUE=3>the function is smooth with respect to the unknown parameters, and
<LI>the <A HREF="../section4/pmd431.html">least squares criterion</A> that is
used to obtain the parameter estimates has a unique solution.
</OL> 
These last two criteria are not essential parts of the definition of a 
nonlinear least squares model, but are of practical importance.

Some examples of nonlinear models include:

$$ f(x;\vec{\beta}) = \frac{\beta_0 + \beta_1x}{1+\beta_2x} $$

$$ f(x;\vec{\beta}) = \beta_1x^{\beta_2} $$ 

$$ f(x;\vec{\beta}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1\exp(-\beta_2x) $$

$$ f(\vec{x};\vec{\beta}) = \beta_1\sin(\beta_2 + \beta_3x_1) + \beta_4\cos(\beta_5 + \beta_6x_2) $$

<I>Advantages of Nonlinear Least Squares</I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%>
The biggest advantage of nonlinear least squares regression over many other
techniques is the broad range of functions that can be fit.  Although many
scientific and engineering processes can be described well using linear
models, or other relatively simple types of models, there are many other
processes that are inherently nonlinear.  
For example, the strengthening of concrete as it cures is a nonlinear process.
Research on concrete strength shows that the strength increases quickly
at first and then levels off, or approaches an asymptote in mathematical terms,
over time.  
Linear models do not describe processes that asymptote very well because for all
linear functions the function value can't increase or decrease at a declining rate 
as the explanatory variables go to the extremes.  There are many types of nonlinear 
models, on the other hand, that describe the asymptotic behavior of a 
process well.  Like the asymptotic behavior of some processes, other features
of physical processes can often be expressed more easily using nonlinear models
than with simpler model types.

<TD WIDTH=85%>
Being a "least squares" procedure, nonlinear least squares has some
of the same advantages (and disadvantages) that linear least squares regression
has over other methods.  One common advantage is efficient use of data.
Nonlinear regression can produce good estimates of the unknown parameters in
the model with relatively small data sets.
Another advantage that nonlinear least squares shares with linear least squares
is a fairly well-developed theory for computing confidence, prediction and 
calibration intervals to answer scientific and engineering questions.  In most
cases the probabilistic interpretation of the intervals produced by nonlinear
regression are only approximately correct, but these intervals  still work very
well in practice.

<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top>
<I>Disadvantages of Nonlinear Least Squares</I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%>
The major cost of moving to nonlinear least squares regression
from simpler modeling techniques like linear least squares is the need to use
iterative optimization procedures to compute the parameter estimates.  With 
functions that are linear in the parameters, the least squares
estimates of the parameters can always be obtained analytically, while that
is generally not the case with nonlinear models.  The use of iterative
procedures requires the user to provide starting values for the unknown
parameters before the software can begin the optimization.  The starting 
values must be reasonably close to the as yet unknown parameter estimates or
the optimization procedure may not converge.  Bad starting values can also
cause the software to converge to a local minimum rather than the global 
minimum that defines the least squares estimates.

<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top>
<I></I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%>
Disadvantages shared with the linear least squares procedure includes a strong
sensitivity to outliers.  Just as in a linear least squares analysis, the
presence of one or two outliers in the data can seriously affect the results
of a nonlinear analysis.  In addition there are unfortunately fewer model
validation tools for the detection of outliers in nonlinear regression than
there are for linear regression.

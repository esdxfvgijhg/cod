As mentioned in the <A HREF="pmd13.html">page introducing the different uses of
process models</A>,
the goal of calibration is to quantitatively convert measurements made on
one of two measurement scales to the other measurement scale.  The
two scales are generally not of equal importance, so the conversion occurs in only one
direction.  The primary measurement scale is usually the scientifically 
relevant scale and measurements made directly on this scale are often the
more precise (relatively) than measurements made on the secondary scale.
A process model describing the relationship between the two measurement
scales provides the means for conversion.  A process model that is constructed
primarily for the purpose of calibration is often referred to as a
"calibration curve".  A graphical depiction of the calibration process is
shown in the plot below, using the example described next.

Thermocouples are a common type of temperature measurement device that is
often more practical than a thermometer for temperature assessment.
Thermocouples measure temperature in terms of voltage, however, rather than
directly on a temperature scale.  In addition, the response of a particular
thermocouple depends on the exact formulation of the metals used to construct
it, meaning two thermocouples will respond somewhat differently under identical
measurement conditions.  As a result, thermocouples need to be calibrated to
produce interpretable measurement information.  The calibration curve for a 
thermocouple is often constructed by comparing thermocouple output to
relatively precise thermometer data.  Then, when a new temperature is
measured with the thermocouple, the voltage is converted to temperature
terms by plugging the observed voltage into the regression equation and
solving for temperature.

The plot below shows a calibration curve for a thermocouple fit with a
locally quadratic model using a method called <A HREF="pmd144.html">LOESS</A>.
Traditionally,
complicated, high-degree polynomial models have been used for thermocouple
calibration, but locally linear or quadratic models offer better
computational stability and more flexibility.  With the locally quadratic
model the solution of the regression equation for temperature is done
numerically rather than analytically, but the concept of calibration is
identical regardless of which type of model is used.  It is important to note
that the thermocouple measurements, made on the secondary measurement scale,
are treated as the response variable and the more precise thermometer results,
on the primary scale, are treated as the predictor variable because this best
satisfies the <A HREF="../section2/pmd216.html">underlying assumptions</A> of
the analysis.

Just as in estimation or prediction, if the calibration experiment were repeated, the
results would vary slighly due to the randomness in the data and the need
to sample a limited amount of data from the process.  This means that an
uncertainty statement that quantifies how much the results of a particular
calibration could vary due to randomness is necessary.  The plot below shows
what would happen if the thermocouple calibration were repeated under
conditions identical to the first experiment.

<I>Calibration Uncertainty</I>

<TD WIDTH=85%>
Again, as with prediction, the data used to fit the process model can also
be used to determine the uncertainty in the calibration.  Both the variation
in the estimated model parameters and in the new voltage observation need to
be accounted for.  This is similar to uncertainty for the prediction  of a new
measurement.  In fact, calibration intervals are computed by solving for the
predictor variable value in the formulas for a prediction interval end points. 
The plot below shows a 99 % calibration interval for the original calibration
data used in the first plot on this page.  The area of interest in the plot has
been magnified so the endpoints of the interval can be visually differentiated.
The calibration interval is 387.3748 &plusmn; <!-- +/- --> 0.307 degrees Celsius.

In almost all calibration applications the ultimate
quantity of  interest is the true value of the primary-scale measurement
method associated with a measurement made on the secondary scale.  As a result,
there are no analogs of the prediction interval or tolerance interval in
calibration.

<TD WIDTH=85%>
As mentioned <A HREF="pmd13.html">earlier</A>, the goal of optimization is to
determine the necessary process input values to obtain a desired output.  Like
calibration, optimization involves substitution of an output value for
the response variable and solving for the associated predictor variable values.
The process model is again the link that ties the inputs and output together.
Unlike calibration and prediction, however, successful optimization requires
a cause-and-effect relationship between the predictors and the response
variable.  Designed experiments, run in a randomized order, must be used to
ensure that the process model represents a cause-and-effect relationship
between the variables.  Quadratic models are typically used, along
with standard calculus techniques for finding minimums and maximums, to carry
out an optimization.  Other techniques can also be used, however.  The example 
discussed below includes a graphical depiction of the optimization process.

<I>Example</I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%>
In a manufacturing process that requires a chemical reaction to take place,
the temperature and pressure under which the process is carried out can affect
reaction time.  To maximize the throughput of this process, an optimization
experiment was carried out in the neighborhood of the conditions felt to
be best, using a 
<A HREF="../../pri/section3/pri3361.html">central composite design</A>
with 13 runs.  Calculus was used to determine the input values associated with
local extremes in the regression function.  The plot below shows the quadratic
surface that was fit to the data and conceptually how the input values associated
with the maximum throughput are found.

As with prediction and calibration, randomness in the data and the need to sample
data from the process affect the results.  If the optimization experiment were
carried out again under identical conditions, the optimal input values computed
using the model would be slightly different.  Thus, it is important to
understand how much random variability there is in the results in order to interpret the
results correctly.

<I>Optimization Uncertainty</I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%>
As with prediction and calibration, the uncertainty in the input values estimated
to maximize throughput can also be computed from the data used to fit the model. 
Unlike prediction or calibration, however, optimization almost always involves
simultaneous estimation of several quantities, the values of the process inputs.
As a result, we will compute a joint confidence region for all of the input
values, rather than separate uncertainty intervals for each input.  This
confidence region will contain the complete set of true process inputs that will
maximize throughput with high probability.  The plot below shows the contours
of equal throughput on a map of various possible input value combinations.  The
solid contours show throughput while the dashed contour in the center encloses
the plausible combinations of input values that yield optimum results.  The
"+" marks the estimated optimum value.  The dashed region is a 95 % joint
confidence region for the two process inputs.  In this region the throughput
of the process will be approximately 217 units/hour.

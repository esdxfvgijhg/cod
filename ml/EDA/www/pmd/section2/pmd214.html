<I>Primary Need for Distribution Information is Inference</I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%>
After fitting a model to the data and validating it, scientific or engineering
questions about the process are usually answered by computing statistical
intervals for relevant process quantities using the model.  These intervals
give the range of plausible values for the process parameters based on the
data and the underlying assumptions about the process.  Because of the
<A HREF="pmd211.html#sp">statistical nature of the process</A>, however, the
intervals cannot always be
guaranteed to include the true process parameters and still be narrow enough
to be useful.  Instead the intervals  have a probabilistic interpretation that
guarantees coverage of the true process parameters a specified proportion of
the time.  In order for these intervals
to truly have their specified probabilistic interpretations, the form of the
distribution of the random errors must be known.  Although the form of the
probability distribution must be known, the parameters of the distribution
can be estimated from the data.

Of course the random errors from different types of processes could be
described by any one of a wide range of different probability distributions
in general, including the uniform, triangular, double exponential, binomial and
Poisson distributions.  With most process modeling methods, however, inferences
about the process are based on the idea that the random errors are drawn from a
normal distribution.  One reason this is done is because the normal distribution
often describes the actual distribution of the random errors in real-world
processes reasonably well.  The normal distribution is also used because the mathematical
theory behind it is well-developed and supports a broad array of inferences on
functions of the data relevant to different types of questions about the
process.

<I>Non-Normal Random Errors May Result in Incorrect Inferences</I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%>
Of course, if it turns out that the random errors in the process are not
normally distributed, then any inferences made about the process may be
incorrect.  If the true distribution of the random errors is such that the
scatter in the data is less than it would be under a normal distribution, it
is possible that the intervals used to capture the values of the process
parameters will simply be a little longer than necessary.  The intervals will then
contain the true process parameters more often than expected.  It is more
likely, however, that the intervals will be too short or will be shifted away
from the true mean value of the process parameter being estimated.  This will
result in intervals that contain the true process parameters less often than
expected.  When this is the case, the intervals produced under the normal
distribution assumption will likely lead to incorrect conclusions being drawn
about the process.

<I>Parameter Estimation Methods Can Require Gaussian Errors</I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%>
The methods used for parameter estimation can also imply the assumption of
normally  distributed random errors.  Some methods, like 
<A HREF="../../apr/section4/apr412.html">maximum likelihood</A>,
use the distribution of the random errors directly to obtain parameter 
estimates.  Even methods that do not use distributional methods for parameter
estimation directly, like least squares, often work best for data that are
free from extreme random fluctuations.  The normal distribution is one of
the probability distributions in which extreme random errors are rare.  If
some other distribution actually describes the random errors better than the 
normal distribution does, then different parameter estimation methods might 
need to be used in order to obtain good estimates of the values of the unknown
parameters in the model.

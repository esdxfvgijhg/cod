<I><A NAME="sp">"Statistical" Implies Random Variation</A></I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%>
The most basic assumption inherent to all statistical methods for process
modeling is that the process to be described is actually a statistical process.
This assumption seems so obvious that it is sometimes overlooked by analysts
immersed in the details of a process or in a rush to uncover information of
interest from an exciting new data set.  However, in order to successfully
model a process using statistical methods, it must include random variation.
Random variation is what makes the process statistical rather than purely
deterministic.

<I><A NAME="rrv">Role of Random Variation</A></I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%>
The overall goal of all statistical procedures, including those designed for
process modeling, is to enable valid conclusions to be drawn from noisy data.
As a result, statistical procedures are designed to compare apparent effects
found in a data set to the noise in the data in order to determine whether the effects
are more likely to be caused by a repeatable underlying phenomenon of some
sort or by fluctuations in the data that happened by chance.  Thus
the random variation in the process serves as a baseline for drawing
conclusions about the nature of the deterministic part of the process.  If
there were no random noise in the process, then conclusions based on
statistical methods would no longer make sense or be appropriate.

<I>This Assumption Usually Valid</I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%>
Fortunately this assumption is valid for most physical processes.  
There will be random error in the measurements almost any time things need to be measured.
In fact, there are often other sources of random error, over and above
measurement error, in complex, real-life processes.  However, examples of
non-statistical processes include
<OL>
<LI>physical processes in which the random error is negligible compared to the
    systematic errors,
<LI>processes based on deterministic computer simulations,
<LI>processes based on theoretical calculations.
</OL>
If models of these types of processes are needed, use of mathematical rather than
statistical process modeling tools would be more appropriate.

<I>Distinguishing Process Types</I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%>
One sure indicator that a process is statistical is if repeated observations
of the process response under a particular fixed condition yields different
results.  The converse, repeated observations of the process response always
yielding the same value, is not a sure indication of a non-statistical process,
however.  For example, in some types of computations in which complex numerical
methods are used to approximate the solutions of theoretical equations, the
results of a computation might deviate from the true solution in an essentially
random way because of the interactions of round-off errors, multiple levels of
approximation, stopping rules, and other sources of error.  Even so, the result
of the computation might be the same each time it is repeated because all of
the initial conditions of the calculation are reset to the same values each
time the calculation is made.  As a result, scientific or engineering knowledge
of the process must also always be used to determine whether or not a given
process is statistical.

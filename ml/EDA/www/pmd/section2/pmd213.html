<I>All Data Treated Equally by Most Process Modeling Methods</I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%>
Due to the presence of random variation, it can be difficult to determine
whether or not all of the data in a data set are of equal quality.  As a
result, most process modeling procedures treat all of the data equally
when using it to estimate the unknown parameters in the model.  Most methods
also use a single estimate of the amount of random variability in the data
for computing prediction and calibration uncertainties.  Treating all of the
data in the same way also yields simpler, easier-to-use models.  Not
surprisingly, however, the decision to treat the data like this can have a
negative effect on the quality of the resulting model too, if it turns out
the data are not all of equal quality.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top>
<I>Data Quality Measured by Standard Deviation</I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%>
Of course data quality can't be measured point-by-point since it is clear
from direct observation of the data that the amount of error in each point
varies.  Instead, points that have the same underlying average squared error,
or <I>variance</I>, are considered to be of equal quality.  Even though the
specific process response values observed at points that meet this criterion
will have different errors, the data collected at such points will be of equal
quality over repeated data collections.  Since the standard deviation of the 
data at each set of explanatory variable values is simply the square root of 
its variance, the standard deviation of the data for each different combination
of explanatory variables can also be used to measure data quality.  The
standard deviation is preferred, in fact, because it has the advantage of being
measured in the same units as the response variable, making it easier to
relate to this statistic.
</TD>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top>
<I>Assumption Not Needed for Weighted Least Squares</I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%>
The assumption that the random errors have constant standard deviation is
not implicit to <A HREF="../section1/pmd143.html">weighted least squares
regression</A>.  Instead, it is assumed that the weights provided in the
analysis correctly indicate the differing levels of variability present in
the response variables.
The weights are then used to adjust the amount of influence each data point
has on the estimates of the model parameters to an appropriate level.  They
are also used to adjust prediction and calibration uncertainties to the correct
levels for different regions of the data set.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top>
<I>Assumption Does Apply to LOESS</I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%>
Even though it uses weighted least squares to estimate the model parameters,  
<A HREF="../section1/pmd144.html">LOESS</A> still relies on the assumption of
a constant standard deviation.  The weights used in LOESS actually reflect the
relative level of similarity between mean response values at neighboring
points in the explanatory variable space rather than the level of response
precision at each set of explanatory variable values.  Actually, because LOESS
uses separate parameter estimates in each localized subset of data, it 
does not require the assumption of a constant standard deviation of the data
for parameter estimation.  The subsets of data used in LOESS are usually small
enough that the precision of the data is roughly constant within each subset.  LOESS
normally makes no provisions for adjusting uncertainty computations for
differing levels of precision across a data set, however.

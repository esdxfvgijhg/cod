<I>Data Must Reflect the Process</I>

Since <A HREF="pmd211.html#rrv">the random variation inherent in the process is 
critical to obtaining satisfactory results from most modeling methods</A>, it
is important that the data reflect that random variation in a
representative way.  Because of the nearly infinite number of ways
non-representative sampling might be done, however, few, if any, statistical
methods would ever be able to correct for the effects that would have on the
data.  Instead, these methods rely on the assumption that the data will be
representative of the process. This means that if the variation in the data
is not representative of the process, the nature of the
deterministic part of the model, described by the function, 
\(f(\vec{x};\vec{\beta})\),
<!-- <IMG ALT="f(\vec{x};\vec{\beta})" SRC="eqns/f.gif">, --> 
will be incorrect.  This, in turn, is likely to lead
to incorrect conclusions being drawn when the model is used
to answer scientific or engineering questions about the process.

<I>Data Best Reflects the Process Via Unbiased Sampling</I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%>
Given that we can never determine what the actual random errors in a particular
data set are, representative samples of data are best obtained by randomly
sampling data from the process.  In a simple random sample, every response from
the population(s) being sampled has an equal chance of being observed. As a
result, while it cannot guarantee that each sample will be
representative of the process, random sampling does ensure that the act of data
collection does not leave behind any biases in the data, on average.  This means
that most of the time, over repeated samples, the data will be representative
of the process.  In addition, under random sampling, probability theory can be
used to quantify how often particular modeling procedures will be affected by
relatively extreme variations in the data, allowing us to control the error
rates experienced when answering questions about the process.

<I>This Assumption Relatively Controllable</I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%>
Obtaining data is of course something that is actually done by the analyst
rather than being a feature of the process itself.  This gives the analyst
some ability to ensure that this assumption will be valid.  Paying careful
attention to data collection procedures and employing experimental design
principles like randomization of the run order will yield a sample of data
that is as close as possible to being perfectly randomly sampled from the
process.  <A HREF="../section3/pmd33.html">Section 4.3.3</A> has additional
discussion of  some of the principles of good experimental design.

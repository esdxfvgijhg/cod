      A rational function is simply the ratio of two polynomial
      functions,

$$ y = \frac{a_{n}x^{n} + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + ... + a_{2}x^{2} + a_{1}x + a_{0}} {b_{m}x^{m} + b_{m-1}x^{m-1}

      models, the constant term in the denominator is usually set to 1.
      <p>
      Rational functions are typically identified by the degrees
      of the numerator and denominator.  For example, a quadratic
      for the numerator and a cubic for the denominator is identified
      as a quadratic/cubic rational function.

      <I>Rational Function Models</I>
   </TD>
   <TD WIDTH=85% VALIGN=top>
      A rational function model is a generalization of the
      polynomial model.  Rational function models contain
      polynomial models as a subset (i.e., the case when the
      denominator is a constant).
      <P>
      If modeling via polynomial models is inadequate due to any
      of the limitations above, you should consider a rational
      function model.
      <P>
      Note that fitting rational function models is also referred
      to as the Pade approximation.

   <TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top>
      <I>Advantages</I>
   </TD>
   <TD WIDTH=85% VALIGN=top>
      Rational function models have the following advantages.
      <ol>
         <li>Rational function models have a moderately simple
             form.
         <li>Rational function models are a closed family.  As with
             polynomial models, this means that rational function
             models are not dependent on the underlying metric.
         <li>Rational function models can take on an extremely
             wide range of shapes, accommodating a much wider range of
             shapes than does the polynomial family.
         <li>Rational function models have better interpolatory
             properties than polynomial models.  Rational functions
             are typically smoother and less oscillatory than
             polynomial models.
         <li>Rational functions have excellent extrapolatory
             powers.  Rational functions can typically be tailored
             to model the function not only within the domain of
             the data, but also so as to be in agreement with
             theoretical/asymptotic behavior outside the domain of
             interest.
         <li>Rational function models have excellent asymptotic
             properties.  Rational functions can be either finite
             or infinite for finite values, or finite or infinite
             for infinite \(x\)
             <!-- <IMG ALT="x" SRC="eqns/x.gif"> -->
             values.  Thus, rational functions
             can easily be incorporated into a rational function
             model.
         <li>Rational function models can often be used to model
             complicated structure with a fairly low degree in both
             the numerator and denominator.  This in turn means
             that fewer coefficients will be required compared to
             the polynomial model.
         <li>Rational function models are moderately easy to handle
             computationally.  Although they are nonlinear models,
             rational function models are a particularly easy
             nonlinear models to fit.

      <I>Disadvantages</I>
   </TD>
   <TD WIDTH=85% VALIGN=top>
      Rational function models have the following disadvantages.
      <ol>
         <li>The properties of the rational function family are
             not as well known to engineers and scientists as are those
             of the polynomial family.  The literature on the rational
             function family is also more limited.
             Because the properties of the family are often not well 
             understood, it can be  difficult to answer the following
             modeling question:
             <p>
             <ul>
                Given that data has a certain shape, what values
                should be chosen for the degree of the numerator and 
                the degree on the denominator?
             </ul>
             <p>
         <li>Unconstrained rational function fitting can, at times,
             result in undesired nusiance asymptotes (vertically)
             due to roots in the denominator polynomial.  The range
             of \(x\)
             <!-- <IMG ALT="x" SRC="eqns/x.gif"> -->
             values affected by the function "blowing up"
             may be quite narrow, but such asymptotes, when they
             occur, are a nuisance for local interpolation in the
             neighborhood of the asymptote point.  These asymptotes
             are easy to detect by a simple plot of the fitted
             function over the range of the data.  Such asymptotes
             should not discourage you from considering rational
             function models as a choice for empirical modeling.
             These nuisance asymptotes occur occasionally and
             unpredictably, but the gain in flexibility of shapes
             is well worth the chance that they may occur.

   <I>General Properties of Rational Functions</I>
   </TD>
   <TD WIDTH=85% VALIGN=TOP>
   The following are general properties of rational functions.
<UL>
         <li>If the numerator and denominator
             are of the same degree (\(n=m\)),
             <!-- (<i>n</i>=<i>m</i>), -->
             then
             \(y = a_n / b_m\)
             <!-- <i>y</i> = <i>a<sub>n</sub></i>/<i>b</i><sub>m</sub></i> -->
             is a horizontal asymptote of the function.
             <p>
         <li>If the degree of the denominator is greater
             than the degree of the numerator, then \(y=0\)
             <!-- <i>y</i> = 0 -->
             is a horizontal asymptote.
             <p>
         <li>If the degree of the denominator is less
             than the degree of the numerator, then
             there are no horizontal asymptotes.
             <p>
         <li>When \(x\)
             <!-- <I>x</I> -->
             is equal to a root of the denominator
             polynomial, the denominator is zero and there
             is a vertical asymptote.  The exception is the case
             when the root of the denominator is also a
             root of the numerator.  However, for this 
             case we can cancel a factor from both the
             numerator and denominator (and we effectively have
             a lower-degree rational function).

      <I>Starting Values for Rational Function Models</I>
   </TD>
   <TD WIDTH=85% VALIGN=TOP>
      One common difficulty in fitting nonlinear models is
      finding adequate starting values.  A major advantage
      of rational function models is the ability to compute
      starting values using a linear least squares fit.
      <p>
      To do this, choose \(p\)
      <!-- <i><b>p</b></i> -->
      points from the data set, with \(p\)
      <!-- <i><b>p</b></i> -->
      denoting the number of parameters in the rational model.  
      For example, given the linear/quadratic model,

$$ \frac{A_0 + A_1x} {1 + B_1x + B_2x^{2}} \, , $$

<!-- 
      <ul>
         <IMG ALT=" 
\frac{A_0 + A_1x} {1 + B_1x + B_2x^{2}}
" SRC="eqns/linequad.gif">
      </ul>
-->
      we need to select four representative points.
      <P>
      We then perform a linear fit on the model, 

$$ y = A_0 + A_1x + ... + A_{p_n}x^{p_n} - B_1xy - ...  - B_{p_d}x^{p_d}y \, .$$

<!-- 
      <ul>
         <IMG ALT=" 
y = A_0 + A_1x + ... + A_{p_n}x^{p_n} - B_1xy - ...  - B_{p_d}x^{p_d}y
" SRC="eqns/exactpol.gif">
      </ul>
-->

      Here, \(p_n\)
      <!-- <b><i>p<sub>n</sub></b></i> -->
      and \(p_d\)
      <!-- <b><i>p<sub>d</sub></b></i> --> 
      are the degrees of the numerator and denominator, respectively, 
      and the \(x\)
      <!-- <IMG ALT="x" SRC="eqns/x.gif"> -->
      and \(y\)
      <!-- <i><b>y</b></i> -->
      contain the subset of points, not the full data set.
      The estimated coefficients from this fit made using
      the linear least squares algorithm are used as the 
      starting values for fitting the nonlinear
      model to the full data set.
      <p>
<STRONG>Note:</STRONG> This type of fit, with the response variable appearing
on both sides of the function, should <STRONG>only</STRONG> be used to 
obtain starting values for the nonlinear fit. The statistical properties of 
models like this are not well understood.
      <p>
      The subset of points should be selected over the range
      of the data.  It is not critical which points
      are selected, although you should avoid points that
      are obvious outliers.

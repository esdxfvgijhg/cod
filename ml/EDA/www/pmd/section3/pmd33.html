<I>
Experimental Design Principles Applied to Process Modeling
</I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%>
There are six principles of experimental design as applied to
process modeling:
<OL>
   <LI>Capacity for Primary Model
   <LI>Capacity for Alternative Model
   <LI>Minimum Variance of Coefficient Estimators
   <LI>Sample where the Variation Is 
   <LI>Replication
   <LI>Randomization
</OL>
We discuss each in detail below.

</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top>
<I>
Capacity for Primary Model
</I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%>
For your best-guess model, make sure that the design has the
capacity for estimating the coefficients of that model.  For a
simple example of this, if you are fitting a quadratic model, then make
sure you have at least three distinct horixontal axis points.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top>
<I>
Capacity for Alternative Model
</I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%>
If your best-guess model happens to be inadequate, make sure that the
design has the capacity to estimate the coefficients of your
best-guess back-up alternative model (which means implicitly that
you should have already identified such a model).
For a simple example, if you suspect (but are not positive) that a
linear model is appropriate, then it is best to employ a globally
robust design (say, four points at each extreme and three points in
the middle, for a ten-point design) as opposed to the locally
optimal design (such as five points at each extreme).  The locally
optimal design will provide a best fit to the line, but have no
capacity to fit a quadratic.  The globally robust design will provide
a good (though not optimal) fit to the line and additionally provide
a good (though not optimal) fit to the quadratic.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top>
<I>
Minimum Variance of Coefficient Estimators
</I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%>
For a given model, make sure the design has the property of
minimizing the variation of the least squares estimated
coefficients.  This is a general principle that is always in
effect but which in practice is hard to implement for many
models beyond the simpler 1-factor 

$$ y = f(x;\vec{\beta} + \varepsilon) $$

<!-- <p><center>
<IMG ALT="y = f(x;\vec{\beta} + \epsilon)" 
     ALIGN=absmiddle SRC="pmd32_eq3.gif">
</center><p> -->

models.  For more complicated 1-factor models, and for most
multi-factor

$$ y = f(\vec{x};\vec{\beta} + \varepsilon) $$

<!-- <p><center> 
<IMG ALT="y = f(\vec{x};\vec{\beta} + \epsilon)"
     ALIGN=absmiddle SRC="pmd33_eq.gif"> 
</center><p> -->

models, the expressions for
the variance of the least squares estimators, although available,
are complicated and assume more than the analyst typically knows.
The net result is that this principle, though important, is harder
to apply beyond the simple cases.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top>
<I>
Sample Where the Variation Is (Non Constant Variance Case)
</I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%>
Regardless of the simplicity or complexity of the model, there are
situations in which certain regions of the curve are noisier than
others.  A simple case is when there is a linear relationship
between \(x\)
<!-- <IMG ALT="x" SRC="eqns/x.gif"> -->
and \(y\)
<!-- <IMG ALT="y" ALIGN=middle SRC="eqns/y.gif"> -->
but the recording device is proportional rather than absolute 
and so larger values of \(y\)
<!-- <IMG ALT="y" ALIGN=middle SRC="eqns/y.gif"> -->
are intrinsically noisier than smaller values of \(y\).
<!-- <IMG ALT="y" ALIGN=middle SRC="eqns/y.gif">. -->
In such cases, sampling where the variation is
means to have more replicated points in those regions that are
noisier.  The practical answer to how many such replicated
points there should be is

$$ n_{i} = \frac{1} {\sigma_{i}^{2}} $$

<!-- <P><center><IMG ALT="n_{i} = \frac{1} {\sigma_{i}^{2}}
" SRC="eqns/nisigma.gif"></center><P> -->

with \(\sigma_{i}\)
<!-- <IMG ALT="\sigma_{i}" ALIGN=middle SRC="eqns/sigmai.gif">  -->
denoting the theoretical
standard deviation for that given region of the curve.  
Usually \(\sigma_{i}\)
<!-- <IMG ALT="\sigma_{i}" ALIGN=middle SRC="eqns/sigmai.gif"> -->
is estimated by a-priori guesses for
what the local standard deviations are.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top>
<I>
Sample Where the Variation Is (Steep Curve Case)
</I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%>
A common occurence for non-linear models is for some regions of the
curve to be steeper than others.  For example, in fitting an
exponential model (small \(x\)
<!-- <IMG ALT="x" SRC="eqns/x.gif">  -->
corresponding to large \(y\),
<!-- <IMG ALT="y" ALIGN=middle SRC="eqns/y.gif">, -->
and large \(y\)
<!-- <IMG ALT="y" ALIGN=middle SRC="eqns/y.gif">  -->
corresponding to small \(x\))
<!-- <IMG ALT="x" SRC="eqns/x.gif">)  -->
it is often the case that the \(y\)
<!-- <IMG ALT="y" ALIGN=middle SRC="eqns/y.gif">  -->
data in the steep region are intrinsically noisier than the \(y\)
<!-- <IMG ALT="y" ALIGN=middle SRC="eqns/y.gif"> -->
data in the relatively flat regions.  The reason for
this is that commonly the \(x\)
<!-- <IMG ALT="x" SRC="eqns/x.gif"> -->
values themselves have a bit of noise and this \(x\)-noise
<!-- <IMG ALT="x" SRC="eqns/x.gif">-noise -->
gets translated into larger \(y\)-noise
<!-- <IMG ALT="y" ALIGN=middle SRC="eqns/y.gif">-noise  -->
in the steep sections than in the
shallow sections.  In such cases, when we know the shape of the
response curve well enough to identify steep-versus-shallow
regions, it is often a good idea to sample more heavily in the steep
regions than in the shallow regions.  A practical rule-of-thumb for where
to position the \(x\)
<!-- <IMG ALT="x" SRC="eqns/x.gif">  -->
values in such situations is to
<OL>
   <LI>sketch out your best guess for what the resulting curve
       will be;
   <LI>partition the vertical (that is the \(y\))
       <!-- <IMG ALT="y" ALIGN=middle SRC="eqns/y.gif">) -->
       axis into \(n\)
       <!-- <IMG ALT="n" SRC="eqns/n.gif"> -->
       equi-spaced points (with \(n\)
       <!-- <IMG ALT="n" SRC="eqns/n.gif"> -->
       denoting the total number of data points that you can afford); 
   <LI>draw horizontal lines from each vertical axis point to where
       it hits the sketched-in curve.
   <LI>drop a vertical projection line from the curve intersection
       point to the horizontal axis.
</OL>
These will be the recommended \(x\)
<!-- <IMG ALT="x" SRC="eqns/x.gif"> -->
values to use in the design.
<P>
The above rough procedure for an exponentially decreasing curve
would thus yield a logarithmic preponderance of points in the steep
region of the curve and relatively few points in the flatter part
of the curve.

</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top>
<I><A NAME="rep.r1">Replication</A></I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%>
If affordable, replication should be part of every design.
Replication allows us to compute a model-independent estimate of the
process standard deviation.  Such an estimate may then be used as a
criterion in an objective 
<A HREF="../section4/pmd446.html">lack-of-fit test</A> 
to assess whether a given model is adequate.
Such an objective lack-of-fit F-test can be employed only if the design
has built-in replication.  Some replication is essential; replication 
at every point is ideal.

<TR>
<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top>
<I>
<A NAME="rnd.r1">Randomization</A>
</I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%>
Just because the \(x\)'s
<!-- <IMG ALT="x" SRC="eqns/x.gif">'s -->
have some natural ordering does not mean that the data 
should be collected in the same order as the \(x\)'s.
<!-- <IMG ALT="x" SRC="eqns/x.gif">'s. -->
Some aspect of randomization should
enter into every experiment, and experiments for process modeling
are no exception.  Thus if your are sampling ten points on a curve,
the ten \(y\)
<!-- <IMG ALT="y" ALIGN=middle SRC="eqns/y.gif"> -->
values should not be collected by
sequentially stepping through the \(x\)
<!-- <IMG ALT="x" SRC="eqns/x.gif"> -->
values from the smallest to the largest.  If you do so, and if 
some extraneous drifting or wear occurs in the machine, the operator, 
the environment, the measuring device, etc., then that drift will
unwittingly contaminate the \(y\)
<!-- <IMG ALT="y" ALIGN=middle SRC="eqns/y.gif"> -->
values and in turn
contaminate the final fit.  To minimize the effect of such potential
drift, it is best to randomize (use random number tables) the
sequence of the \(x\)
<!-- <IMG ALT="x" SRC="eqns/x.gif"> -->
values.  This will not make the
drift go away, but it will spread the drift effect
evenly over the entire curve, realistically inflating the variation
of the fitted values, and providing some mechanism after the fact
(at the residual analysis model validation stage) for uncovering or
discovering such a drift.  If you do not randomize the run sequence,
you give up your ability to detect such a drift if it occurs.

	Classical Designs Heavily Used in Industry
	</I>
	</TD>
	<TD WIDTH=85%>
	The most heavily used designs in industry are the "classical
	designs" (full factorial designs, fractional factorial
	designs, Latin square designs, Box-Behnken designs, etc.).
	They are so heavily used because they are optimal in their
	own right and have served superbly
	well in providing efficient insight into the underlying
	structure of industrial processes.

	Reasons Classical Designs May Not Work
	</I>
	</TD>
	<TD WIDTH=85%>
	Cases do arise, however, for which the tabulated classical
	designs do not cover a particular practical situation.
	That is, user constraints
	preclude the use of tabulated classical designs
	because such classical designs do not
	accommodate user constraints.  Such constraints include:
	<OL>
	   <LI>Limited maximum number of runs:
	       <P>
	       User constraints in budget and time may dictate a
	       maximum allowable number of runs that is too small
	       or too "irregular" (e.g., "13") to be accommodated by
	       classical designs--even fractional factorial designs.
	       <P>
	   <LI>Impossible factor combinations:
	       <P>
	       The user may have some factor combinations that are
	       impossible to run.  Such combinations may at times be
	       specified (to maintain balance and orthogonality) as
	       part of a recommeded classical design.  If the user
	       simply omits this impossible run from the design, the
	       net effect may be a reduction in the
	       quality and optimaltiy of the classical design.
	       <P>
	   <LI>Too many levels:
	       <P>
	       The number of factors and/or the number of levels of some factors
	       intended for use may not be included in tabulations of classical designs.
	       <P>
	   4. Complicated underlying model:
	       <P>
	       The user may be assuming an underlying model that is
	       too complicated (or too non-linear), so that
	       classical designs would be inappropriate.
	</OL>

	<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top>
	<I>
	What to Do If Classical Designs Do Not Exist?
	</I>
	</TD>
	<TD WIDTH=85%>
	If user constraints are such that classical designs do not exist 
	to accommodate such constraints, then what is the user to do?
	<P>
	The previous section's list of design criteria (capability
	for the primary model, capability for the alternate model,
	minimum variation of estimated coefficients, etc.) is a good
	passive target to aim for in terms of desirable design
	properties, but provides little help in terms of an active formal
	construction methodology for generating a design.

	<TR>
	<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top>
	<I>
	Common Optimality Criteria
	</I>
	</TD>
	<TD WIDTH=85%>
	To satisfy this need, an "optimal design" methodology has
	been developed to generate a  design when user
	constraints preclude the use of tabulated classical designs.
	Optimal designs may be optimal in many different ways, and
	what may be an optimal design according to one criterion may
	be suboptimal for other criteria.  Competing criteria have
	led to a literal alphabet-soup collection of optimal
	design methodologies.  The four most popular ingredients in
	that "soup" are:
	<P>
	<TABLE>
	   <TR>
	      <TD VALIGN=TOP>
		  D-optimal designs:
	      </TD>
	      <TD VALIGN=TOP>
		  minimize the generalized variance of the parameter
		  estimators.
	      </TD>
	   </TR>

	   <TR>
	      <TD VALIGN=TOP>
		  A-optimal designs:
	      </TD>
	      <TD VALIGN=TOP>
		  minimize the average variance of the parameter estimators.
	      </TD>
	   </TR>

	   <TR>
	      <TD valign=top>
		  G-optimal designs:
	      </TD>
	      <TD valign=top>
		  minimize the maximum variance of the predicted values.
	      </TD>
	   </TR>

	   <TR>
	      <TD valign=top>
		  V-optimal designs:
	      </TD>
	      <TD valign=top>
		  minimize the average variance of the predicted values.
	      </TD>
	   </TR>

	</TABLE>
	</TD>
	</TR>

	<TR>
	<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top>
	<I>
	Need 1: a Model
	</I>
	</TD>
	<TD WIDTH=85%>
	The motivation for optimal designs is the practical
	constraints that the user has.  The advantage of optimal
	designs is that they do provide a reasonable
	design-generating methodology when no other mechanism
	exists.  The disadvantage of optimal designs is that they
	require a model from the user.  The user may not have this model.
	<P>
	All optimal designs are model-dependent, and so the quality
	of the final engineering conclusions that result from the
	ensuing design, data, and analysis is dependent on the
	correctness of the analyst's assumed model.  For example, if the
        responses from a particular process are actually being drawn from a cubic 
        model and the analyst assumes a linear model and uses the corresponding optimal
	design to generate data and perform the data analysis, then the
	final engineering conclusions will be flawed and invalid.  Hence one
	price for obtaining an in-hand generated design is the designation of
	a model.  All optimal designs need a model; without a model, the
	optimal design-generation methodology cannot be used, and
	general design principles must be reverted to.

	</TD>
	</TR>

	<TR>
	<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top>
	<I>
	Need 2: a Candidate Set of Points
	</I>
	</TD>
	<TD WIDTH=85%>
The other price for using optimal design methodology is a
user-specified set of candidate points.  Optimal designs
will not generate the best design points from some
continuous region--that is too much to ask of the mathematics.  
Optimal designs will generate the best subset of 
<IMG ALT=" 
n
" SRC="eqns/n.gif"> points from a larger superset of 
candidate points.  The user must specify this candidate set of 
points.  Most commonly, the superset of candidate points is the
full factorial design over a fine-enough grid of the factor
space with which the analyst is comfortable.  If the grid
is too fine, and the resulting superset overly large, then
the optimal design methodology may prove computationally
challenging.

<TR>
<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top>
<I>
Optimal Designs are Computationally Intensive
</I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%>
The optimal design-generation methodology is computationally
intensive.  Some of the designs (e.g., D-optimal) are better
than other designs (such as A-optimal and G-optimal) in
regard to efficiency of the underlying search algorithm.
Like most mathematical optimization techniques, there is no
iron-clad guarantee that the result from the optimal design
methodology is in fact the true optimum.  However, the
results are usually satisfactory from a practical point of
view, and are far superior than any ad hoc designs.

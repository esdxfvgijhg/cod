   <TD WIDTH=85% VALIGN=top>
      As with any regression problem, it is always a good idea
      to plot the raw data first.  The following is a
      <a href="../../eda/section3/scatterp.html">scatter plot</a>
      of the raw data.
      <p>

          alt="scatter plot indicates a linear fit might be appropriate">
      </A>
      <p>
      This scatter plot shows that a straight line fit is a
      good initial candidate model for these data.

   </TD>

   <TD WIDTH=85% VALIGN=top>
      These data were collected in six distinct batches.  The
      first step in the analysis is to determine if there is a
      batch effect.
      <p>
      In this case, the scientist was not inherently interested
      in the batch.  That is, batch is a nuisance factor and, if
      reasonable, we would like to analyze the data as if it came
      from a single batch.  However, we need to know that this is,
      in fact, a reasonable assumption to make.

   <TD WIDTH=85% VALIGN=top>
      We first generate a 
      <a href="../../eda/section3/condplot.html">conditional plot</a>
      where we condition on the batch.
      <p>
      <A HREF="pipeline/plots/batch1_f.gif">
      <IMG SRC="pipeline/plots/batch1_r.gif"
          HEIGHT=425 WIDTH=550 BORDER=0
          alt="conditional plot (on batch) does not show a
               batch effect">
      </A>
      <p>
      This conditional plot shows a scatter plot for each
      of the six batches on a single page.  Each of these
      plots shows a similar pattern.

        Linear Correlation and Related Plots
      </A>
      </I>
   </TD>

   <TD WIDTH=85% VALIGN=top>
      We can follow up the conditional plot with
      a <a href="../../eda/section3/linecorr.html">linear
      correlation plot</a>, 
      a <a href="../../eda/section3/lineinte.html">linear
      intercept plot</a>, 
      a <a href="../../eda/section3/lineslop.html">linear
      slope plot</a>, and
      a <a href="../../eda/section3/linressd.html">linear
      residual standard deviation plot</a>.
      These four plots show the correlation, the intercept and
      slope from a linear fit, and the residual standard deviation
      for linear fits applied to each batch.  These plots show
      how a linear fit performs across the six batches.
      <p>
      <A HREF="pipeline/plots/batch2_f.gif">
      <IMG SRC="pipeline/plots/batch2_r.gif"
          HEIGHT=425 WIDTH=550 BORDER=0
          alt="linear correlation, intercept, slope and ressd plots
               do not show any significant batch effect">
      </A>
      <p>
      The linear correlation plot (upper left), which shows the 
      correlation between field and lab defect sizes versus the 
      batch, indicates that batch six has a somewhat stronger 
      linear relationship between the measurements than the 
      other batches do.  This is also reflected in the significantly
      lower residual standard deviation for batch six shown in the 
      residual standard deviation plot (lower right), which shows the
      residual standard deviation versus batch. The slopes all lie 
      within a range of 0.6 to 0.9 in the linear slope plot (lower left)
      and the intercepts all lie between 2 and 8 in the linear 
      intercept plot (upper right).

   </TD>
</TR>

<TR>
   <TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top>
      <I>
         Treat Batch as Homogeneous
      </I>
   </TD>

   <TD WIDTH=85% VALIGN=top>
      These summary plots, in conjunction with the conditional plot
      above, show that treating the data as a single batch
      is a reasonable assumption to make.  None of the
      batches behaves badly compared to the others and none
      of the batches requires a significantly different
      fit from the others.
      <p>
      These two plots provide a good pair.  The plot of
      the fit statistics allows quick and convenient comparisons
      of the overall fits.  However, the conditional plot can
      reveal details that may be hidden in the summary plots.
      For example, we can more readily determine the existence
      of clusters of points and outliers, curvature in the
      data, and other similar features.
      <P>
      Based on these plots we will ignore the batch variable for
      the remaining analysis.

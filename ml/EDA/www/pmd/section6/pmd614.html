<TD WIDTH=85% VALIGN=top>
After fitting a straight line to the data, many people like to check the 
quality of the fit with a plot of the data overlaid with the estimated
regression function.  The plot below shows this for the load cell data.
Based on this plot, there is no clear evidence of any deficiencies in the
model.

<TD WIDTH=85% VALIGN=top>
This type of overlaid plot is useful for showing the relationship
between the data and the predicted values from the regression function;
however, it can obscure important detail about the model.  Plots of the 
residuals, on the other hand, show this detail well, and should be used
to check the quality of the fit.  Graphical analysis of the residuals is the
single most important technique for determining the need for model refinement
or for verifying that the underlying assumptions of the analysis are met.

<TD WIDTH=85% VALIGN=top>
The structure in the relationship between the residuals and the load clearly 
indicates that the functional part of the model is misspecified.  The ability
of the residual plot to clearly show this problem, while the plot of the data 
did not show it, is due to the difference in scale between the plots.  The 
curvature in the response is much smaller than the linear trend.  Therefore the
curvature is hidden when the plot is viewed in the scale of the data.  When 
the linear trend is subtracted, however, as it is in the residual plot, 
the curvature stands out.

<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top><I></I></TD>
<TD WIDTH=85% VALIGN=top>
The plot of the residuals versus the predicted deflection values shows 
essentially the same structure as the last plot of the residuals versus load.
For more complicated models, however, this plot can reveal problems that are
not clear from plots of the residuals versus the predictor variables.

<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top><A NAME="f4p"><I>Additional Diagnostic Plots</I></A></TD>
<TD WIDTH=85% VALIGN=top>
Further residual diagnostic plots are shown below.  The plots include
a run order plot, a lag plot, a histogram, and a normal probability plot.
Shown in a two-by-two array like this, these plots comprise a 4-plot of the
data that is very useful for checking the assumptions underlying the
model.

<TR>
<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top><I>Interpretation of Plots</I></TD>
<TD WIDTH=85% VALIGN=top>
The structure evident in these residual plots also indicates 
potential problems with different aspects of the model.
Under ideal circumstances, the plots in the top row would not show
any systematic structure in the residuals.  The histogram 
would have a symmetric, bell shape, and the normal probability plot
would be a straight line.  Taken at face value, the structure seen here
indicates a time trend in the data, autocorrelation of
the measurements, and a non-normal distribution of the residuals. 
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top><I>&nbsp;</I></TD>
<TD WIDTH=85% VALIGN=top>
It is likely, however, that these plots will look fine once the function 
describing the systematic relationship between load and deflection has been
corrected.  Problems with one aspect of a regression model often show up
in more than one type of residual plot.  Thus there is currently no clear 
evidence from the 4-plot that the distribution of the residuals from an
appropriate model would be non-normal, or that there would be 
autocorrelation in the process, etc.  If the 4-plot still 
indicates these problems after the functional part of the model has
been fixed, however, the possibility that the problems are real would need
to be addressed.

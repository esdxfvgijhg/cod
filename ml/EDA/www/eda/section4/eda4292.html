The goal of this analysis is to select a probabilistic model 
to describe the dispersion of the measured values of fatigue 
life of specimens of an aluminum alloy described in 
<a href="eda4291.html">[1.4.2.9.1]</a>,
from among several reasonable alternatives.

Simple diagrams can be very informative about location, spread, 
and to detect possibly anomalous data values or particular patterns
(clustering, for example).  These include dot-charts, boxplots,
and histograms. Since building an effective histogram requires
that a choice be made of bin size, and this choice can be
influential, one may wish to examine a non-parametric estimate of
the underlying probability density.
<p>
<IMG SRC="eda4292_r01.gif" height=508 width=550 alt="initial plots">
<p>
These several plots variously show that the measurements range
from a value slightly greater than 350,000 to slightly less than
2,500,000 cycles. The boxplot suggests that the largest
measured value may be an outlier.
<p>
A recommended first step is to check consistency between the data
and what is to be expected if the data were a sample from a
particular probability distribution.  Knowledge about the
underlying properties of materials and of relevant industrial
processes typically offer clues as to the models that should be
entertained.  Graphical diagnostic techniques can be very useful
at this exploratory stage: foremost among these, for univariate
data, is the quantile-quantile plot, or QQ-plot 
<a href="eda43.html#Wilk">(Wilk and Gnanadesikan, 1968)</a>.
<p>
Each data point is represented by one point in the QQ-plot. The
ordinate of each of these points is one data value; if this data
value happens to be the <I>k</I>th order statistic in the sample (that
is, the <I>k</I>th largest value), then the corresponding abscissa is
the "typical" value that the <I>k</I>th largest value should have in
a sample of the same size as the data, drawn from a particular
distribution. If <I>F</I> denotes the cumulative probability
distribution function of interest, and the sample comprises <I>n</I>
values, then  
<I>F</I><sup> -1 </sup> [(<I>k</I> - 1/2) / (<I>n</I> + 1/2)]
is a reasonable choice for that "typical" value, because it is an 
approximation to the median of the <I>k</I>th order statistic in a 
sample of size <I>n</I> from this distribution.
<p>
The following figure shows a QQ-plot of our data relative to the
Gaussian (or, normal) probability distribution. If the data
matched expectations perfectly, then the points would all fall on
a straight line.
<p>
<IMG SRC="eda4292_r02.gif" height=508 width=550 alt="normal probability plot">
<p>
In practice, one needs to gauge whether the deviations from such
perfect alignment are commensurate with the natural variability
associated with sampling. This can easily be done by examining
how variable QQ-plots of samples from the target distribution may
be.
<P>
The following figure shows, superimposed on the QQ-plot of the
data, the QQ-plots of 99 samples of the same size as the data,
drawn from a Gaussian distribution with the same mean and
standard deviation as the data.
<p>
<IMG SRC="eda4292_r03.gif" height=508 width=550 alt="plot of samples from data">
<p>
The fact that the cloud of QQ-plots corresponding to 99 samples
from the Gaussian distribution effectively covers the QQ-plot for
the data, suggests that the chances are better than 1 in 100 that
our data are inconsistent with the Gaussian model.
<P>
This proves nothing, of course, because even the rarest of events
may happen. However, it is commonly taken to be indicative of an
acceptable fit for general purposes. In any case, one may
naturally wonder if an alternative model might not provide an
even better fit.
<P>
Knowing the provenance of the data, that they portray strength of
a material, strongly suggests that one may like to examine
alternative models, because in many studies of reliability
non-Gaussian models tend to be more appropriate than Gaussian
models.

There are many probability distributions that could reasonably be 
entertained as candidate models for the data. However, we will restrict
ourselves to consideration of the following because these have
proven to be useful in reliability studies.

Approach
</I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%>
<!-- Add main text below -->
A very simple approach amounts to comparing QQ-plots of the data 
for the candidate models under consideration. This typically 
involves first fitting the models to the data, for example employing 
the method of maximum likelihood 
<a href="../section3/eda3652.html">[1.3.6.5.2]</a>.
<P>
The maximum likelihood estimates are the following:
<ul>
<li>Gaussian: mean 1401, standard deviation 389</li>
<li>Gamma: shape 11.85, rate 0.00846</li>
<li>Birnbaum-Saunders: shape 0.310, scale 1337</li>
<li>3-parameter Weibull: location 181, shape 3.43, scale 1357</li>
</ul>
The following figure shows how close (or how far) the best
fitting probability densities of the four distributions
approximate the non-parametric probability density estimate. This
comparison, however, takes into account neither the fact that our
sample is fairly small (101 measured values), nor that the fitted
models themselves have been estimated from the same data that the
non-parametric estimate was derived from.
<p>
<IMG SRC="eda4292_r04.gif" height=508 width=550 alt="density curves">
<p>
These limitations notwithstanding, it is worth examining the
corresponding QQ-plots, shown below, which suggest that the
Gaussian and the 3-parameter Weibull may be the best models.
<p>

<I>Model Selection</I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%>
<!-- Add main text below -->
A more careful comparison of the merits of the alternative models 
needs to take into account the fact that the 3-parameter Weibull 
model (precisely because it has three parameters), may be 
intrinsically more flexible than the others, which all have two 
adjustable parameters only.
<P>
Two criteria can be employed for a formal comparison: Akaike's
Information Criterion (AIC), and the Bayesian Information
Criterion (BIC) 
<a href="eda43.html#Hastie">(Hastie et. al., 2001)</a>. 
The smaller the value of either model selection criterion, the better
the model:
<P>
<PRE>
      AIC  BIC
 GAU 1495 1501
 GAM 1499 1504
 BS  1507 1512
 WEI 1498 1505
</PRE>
<P>
On this basis (and according both to AIC and BIC), there seems to
be no cogent reason to replace the Gaussian model by any of the
other three. The values of BIC can also be used to derive an
approximate answer to the question of how strongly the data may
support each of these models. Doing this involves the application
of Bayesian statistical methods 
<a href="../../apr/section1/apr1a.html">[8.1.10]</a>.

<P>
We start from an <I>a priori</I> assignment of equal
probabilities to all four models, indicating that we have no
reason to favor one over another at the outset, and then update
these probabilities based on the measured values of lifetime. The
updated probabilities of the four models, called their
<I>posterior probabilities</I>, are approximately proportional to
exp(-BIC(GAU)/2),
exp(-BIC(GAM)/2), 
exp(-BIC(BS)/2), and
exp(-BIC(WEI)/2). 
The values are 76 % for GAU, 16 % for GAM, 0.27 %
for BS, and 7.4 % for WEI.
<P>
One possible use for the selected model is to answer the question
of the age in service by which a part or structure needs to be
replaced to guarantee that the probability of failure does not
exceed some maximum acceptable value, for example 0.1 %.The
answer to this question is the 0.1st percentile of the fitted
distribution, that is 
<I>G</I><sup> -1 </sup>(0.001) = 198 thousand
cycles, where, in this case, 
<I>G</I><sup> -1 </sup> denotes the inverse of the fitted, 
Gaussian probability distribution.
<P>
To assess the uncertainty of this estimate one may employ the
statistical bootstrap 
<a href="../section3/eda334.html">[1.3.3.4]</a>.
In this case, this involves
drawing a suitably large number of bootstrap samples from the
data, and for each of them applying the model fitting and model
selection exercise described above, ending with the calculation
of <I>G</I><sup> -1 </sup>(0.001)
for the best model (which may vary from sample to sample).
<P>
The bootstrap samples should be of the same size as the data,
with each being drawn uniformly at random from the data, <i>with</i>
replacement. This process, based on 5,000 bootstrap samples,
yielded a 95 % confidence interval for the 0.1st percentile
ranging from 40 to 366 thousands of cycles. The large uncertainty
is not surprising given that we are attempting to estimate the
largest value that is exceeded with probability 99.9 %, based
on a sample comprising only 101 measured values.

Prediction Intervals

One more application in this analysis is to evaluate
prediction intervals for the fatigue life of the aluminum 
alloy specimens.  For example,
if we were to test three new specimens using
the same process, we would want to know (with 95 % confidence)
the minimum number of cycles for these three specimens.  That is,
we need to find a statistical interval [<i>L</i>, &infin;]
that contains the fatigue life of all three future
specimens with 95 % confidence.  The desired interval is a
one-sided, lower 95 % prediction interval.  Since tables
of factors for constructing <i>L</i>, are widely available
for normal models, we use the results corresponding to
the normal model here for illustration.  Specifically,
<i>L</i> is computed as

<P>
where factor <i>r</i> is given in Table A.14 of 
<a href="eda43.html#Hahn">Hahn and Meeker (1991)</a>
or can be obtained from an
<a href="eda4292_rcode.r">R program</a>.

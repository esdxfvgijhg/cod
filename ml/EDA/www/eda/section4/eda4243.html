As a first step in the analysis, common summary statistics were
computed from the data.  
<PRE>
      Sample size  = 700
      Mean         =   2898.562
      Median       =   2899.000  
      Minimum      =   2895.000  
      Maximum      =   2902.000  
      Range        =      7.000  
      Stan. Dev.   =      1.305
</PRE>
Because of the discrete nature of the data, we also compute 
the normal PPCC.
<PRE>
      Normal PPCC = 0.97484

Location

<TD WIDTH=85%>
<!-- Add main text below -->
One way to quantify a change in location over time is to
<a href="../../pmd/section1/pmd141.html">fit a straight line</a>
to the data using an index variable as the independent
variable in the regression.  For our data, we assume 
that data are in sequential run order and that the 
data were collected at equally spaced time intervals.  In our regression,
we use the index variable X = 1, 2, ..., N, where N is the number 
of observations.  If there is no significant drift in the location 
over time, the slope parameter should be zero. 
<PRE>
      Coefficient     Estimate     Stan. Error      <I>t</I>-Value
          B<sub>0</sub>         2.898E+03       9.745E-02    29739.288  
          B<sub>1</sub>         1.071E-03       2.409e-04        4.445
 
      Residual Standard Deviation = 1.288
      Residual Degrees of Freedom = 698 
</PRE>
</FONT>
The slope parameter, B<sub>1</sub>, has a 
<a href="../../pmd/section4/pmd43.html"><i>t</i> value</a> of 4.445 which is
statistically significant (the critical value is 1.96).  However, the
value of the slope is 1.071E-03.  Given that the slope is nearly zero,
the assumption of constant location is not seriously violated
even though it is statistically significant.

<A NAME="VARIATION">

Variation

</A>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%>
<!-- Add main text below -->
One simple way to detect a change in variation is with a
<a href="../section3/eda357.html">Bartlett test</a> after dividing the
data set into several equal-sized intervals.  However, the Bartlett
test is not robust for non-normality.  Since the nature of the data
(a few distinct points repeated many times) makes the normality
assumption questionable,
we use the alternative <a href="../section3/eda358.html">Levene
test</a>.  In particular, we use the Levene test based on the median
rather the mean.  The choice of the number of intervals is somewhat
arbitrary, although values of four or eight are reasonable.  We will divide 
our data into four intervals.
<PRE>
      H<SUB>0</SUB>:  &sigma;<SUB>1</SUB><sup>2</sup> = &sigma;<SUB>2</SUB><sup>2</sup> = &sigma;<SUB>3</SUB><sup>2</sup> = &sigma;<SUB>4</SUB><sup>2</sup> 
      H<SUB>a</SUB>:  At least one &sigma;<SUB>i</SUB><sup>2</sup> is not equal to the others.

      Test statistic:  <I>W</I> = 1.43
      Degrees of freedom:  <I>k</I> - 1 = 3
      Significance level:  <i>&alpha;</i> = 0.05
      Critical value:  <I>F</I><sub><i>&alpha;</i>,<I>k</I>-1,<I>N-k</I></sub> = 2.618
      Critical region:  Reject H<SUB>0</SUB> if <I>W</I> > 2.618
</PRE>
Since the Levene test statistic value of 1.43 is less than the
95 % critical value of 2.618, we conclude that the variances
are not significantly different in the four intervals.

Randomness

</A>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%>
<!-- Add main text below -->
There are many ways in which data can be non-random.  However,
most common forms of non-randomness can be detected with a
few simple tests.  The <a href="eda4242.html#LAGPLOT">lag plot in the
previous section</a> is a simple graphical technique.
<p>
Another check is an autocorrelation plot that shows the
<a href="../section3/eda35c.html">autocorrelations</a>
for various lags.  Confidence bands can be plotted at
the 95 % and 99 % confidence levels.  Points outside this band indicate
statistically significant values (lag 0 is always 1).  
<p>
<IMG SRC="soulen/gif/autocorr.gif" alt="autocorrelation plot">
<p>
The lag 1 autocorrelation, which is generally the one of most interest,
is 0.31.  The critical values at the 5 % level of significance are
-0.087 and 0.087.  This indicates that the lag 1 autocorrelation is
statistically significant, so there is some evidence for
non-randomness.
<p>
A common test for randomness is the
<a href="../section3/eda35d.html">runs test</a>.
<PRE>
      H<SUB>0</SUB>:  the sequence was produced in a random manner
      H<SUB>a</SUB>:  the sequence was not produced in a random manner  

      Test statistic:  <I>Z</I> = -13.4162
      Significance level:  <i>&alpha;</i> = 0.05
      Critical value:  <I>Z</I><sub>1-<i>&alpha;</i>/2</sub> = 1.96 
      Critical region:  Reject H<SUB>0</SUB> if |<I>Z</I>| > 1.96 

</PRE>
The runs test indicates non-randomness.
<P>
Although the runs test and lag 1 autocorrelation indicate some
mild non-randomness, it is not sufficient to reject the
<b><i>Y<sub>i</sub> = C + E<sub>i</sub></i></b> model.  At least
part of the non-randomness can be explained by the discrete nature
of the data.

<TD WIDTH=85%>
<!-- Add main text below -->
Probability plots are a graphical test for assessing if a
particular distribution provides an adequate fit to a data
set.
<p>
A quantitative enhancement to the probability plot is the correlation
coefficient of the points on the probability plot, or PPCC.  For this
data set the PPCC based on a normal distribution is 0.975.  Since the 
PPCC is less than the critical value of 0.987 (this is a
<a href="../section3/eda3676.html">tabulated value</a>),
the normality assumption is rejected.
<p>
<a href="../section3/eda35f.html">Chi-square</a> and
<a href="../section3/eda35g.html">Kolmogorov-Smirnov</a>
goodness-of-fit tests are
alternative methods for assessing distributional adequacy.
The <a href="../../prc/section2/prc213.html">Wilk-Shapiro</a>
and <a href="../section3/eda35e.html">Anderson-Darling</a>
tests can be used to test for normality.  The results of the
Anderson-Darling test follow.  
<PRE>
      H<sub>0</sub>:  the data are normally distributed
      H<sub>a</sub>:  the data are not normally distributed

      Adjusted test statistic:  <I>A</I><SUP>2</SUP> = 16.858
      Significance level:  <i>&alpha;</i> = 0.05
      Critical value:  0.787
      Critical region:  Reject H<sub>0</sub> if <I>A</I><SUP>2</SUP> > 0.787
</PRE>
The Anderson-Darling test rejects the normality
assumption because the test statistic, 16.858, is greater than the
95 % critical value 0.787.
<p>
Although the data are not strictly normal, the violation of the
normality assumption is not severe enough to conclude that the
<b><i>Y<sub>i</sub> = C + E<sub>i</sub></i></b> model is
unreasonable.  At least part of the non-normality can be explained
by the discrete nature of the data.

A test for outliers is the <a href="../section3/eda35h.html">Grubbs
test</a>.  
<PRE>
      H<sub>0</sub>:  there are no outliers in the data
      H<sub>a</sub>:  the maximum value is an outlier

For this data set, Grubbs' test does not detect any outliers at

 Analysis for Josephson Junction Cryothermometry Data
  
 1: Sample Size                           = 700
  
 2: Location
    Mean                                  = 2898.562
    Standard Deviation of Mean            = 0.049323
    95% Confidence Interval for Mean      = (2898.465,2898.658)
    Drift with respect to location?       = YES
    (Further analysis indicates that
    the drift, while statistically
    significant, is not practically
    significant)
  
 3: Variation
    Standard Deviation                    = 1.30497
    95% Confidence Interval for SD        = (1.240007,1.377169)
    Drift with respect to variation?
    (based on Levene's test on quarters
    of the data)                          = NO
  
 4: Distribution
    Normal PPCC                           = 0.97484
    Normal Anderson-Darling               = 16.7634
    Data are Normal?
      (as tested by Normal PPCC)          = NO
      (as tested by Anderson-Darling)     = NO
  
 5: Randomness
    Autocorrelation                       = 0.314802
    Data are Random?
      (as measured by autocorrelation)    = NO
  
 6: Statistical Control
    (i.e., no drift in location or scale,
    data are random, distribution is 
    fixed, here we are testing only for
    fixed normal)
    Data Set is in Statistical Control?   = NO
  
    Note: Although we have violations of
    the assumptions, they are mild enough,
    and at least partially explained by the
    discrete nature of the data, so we may model
    the data as if it were in statistical
    control
  
 7: Outliers?
    (as determined by Grubbs test)        = NO

Maximum likelihood estimation begins with the mathematical
expression known as a likelihood function of the sample data.
Loosely speaking, the likelihood of a set of data is the probability
of obtaining that particular set of data given the chosen probability
model.  This expression contains the unknown parameters.  Those
values of the parameter that maximize the sample likelihood are known
as the maximum likelihood estimates.
<p>
The <a href="../../apr/section4/apr412.html">reliability chapter</a>
contains some examples of the likelihood functions for a few of the
commonly used distributions in reliability analysis.

Advantages
</I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%>
<!-- Add main text below -->
The advantages of this method are:
<ul>
   <li>Maximum likelihood provides a consistent approach to
       parameter estimation problems.  This means that maximum
       likelihood estimates can be developed for a large variety
       of estimation situations.  For example, they can be applied
       in reliability analysis to censored data under various
       censoring models.
       <p>
   <li>Maximum likelihood methods have desirable mathematical
       and optimality properties.  Specifically,
       <ol>
          <li>They become minimum variance unbiased estimators as
              the sample size increases.  By unbiased, we mean
              that if we take (a very large number of) random samples
              with replacement from a population, the average value of
              the parameter estimates will be theoretically exactly
              equal to the population value.  By minimum variance, we
              mean that the estimator has the smallest variance, and
              thus the narrowest confidence interval, of all estimators
              of that type.
          <li>They have approximate normal distributions and
              approximate sample variances that can be used to
              generate confidence bounds and hypothesis tests
              for the parameters.
       </ol>
       <p>
   <li>Several popular statistical software packages provide
       excellent algorithms for maximum likelihood estimates
       for many of the commonly used distributions.  This helps
       mitigate the computational complexity of maximum likelihood
       estimation.

Disadvantages
</I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%>
<!-- Add main text below -->
The disadvantages of this method are:
<ul>
   <li>The likelihood equations need to be specifically worked
       out for a given distribution and estimation problem.  The
       mathematics is often non-trivial, particularly if confidence
       intervals for the parameters are desired.
       <p>
   <li>The numerical estimation is usually non-trivial.  Except for
       a few cases where the maximum likelihood formulas are
       in fact simple, it is generally best to rely on
       high quality statistical software to obtain maximum likelihood
       estimates.  Fortunately, high quality maximum likelihood
       software is becoming increasingly common.
       <p>
   <li>Maximum likelihood estimates can be heavily biased for small
       samples.  The optimality properties may not apply for small
       samples.
       <p>
   <li>Maximum likelihood can be sensitive to the choice of starting
       values.
</ul>

Software
</I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%>
<!-- Add main text below -->
Most general purpose statistical software programs support
maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) in some form.  MLE
estimation can be supported in two ways.
<ol>
   <li>A software program may provide a generic function
       minimization (or equivalently, maximization) capability.
       This is also referred to as function optimization.
       Maximum likelihood estimation is essentially a function
       optimization problem.
       <p>
       This type of capability is particularly common in mathematical
       software programs.
       <p>
   <li>A software program may provide MLE computations for a
       specific problem.  For example, it may generate ML estimates
       for the parameters of a Weibull distribution.
       <p>
       Statistical software programs will often provide ML estimates
       for many specific problems even when they do not support
       general function optimization.

</ol>
The advantage of function minimization software is that it can be
applied to many different MLE problems.  The drawback is that
you have to specify the maximum likelihood equations to the
software.  As the functions can be non-trivial, there is potential
for error in entering the equations.
<p>
The advantage of the specific MLE procedures is that greater
efficiency and better numerical stability can often be obtained
by taking advantage of the properties of the specific estimation
problem.  The specific methods often return explicit confidence
intervals.  In addition, you do not have to know or specify the
likelihood equations to the software.  The disadvantage is that each
MLE problem must be specifically coded.

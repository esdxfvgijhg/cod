<!-- Add main text below -->
The techniques discussed in this section are classical statistical
methods as opposed to EDA techniques.  EDA and classical techniques
are not mutually exclusive and can be used in a complementary
fashion.  For example, the analysis can start with some simple
graphical techniques such as the 4-plot followed by the classical
confirmatory methods discussed herein to provide more rigorous statements
about the conclusions.  If the classical methods yield different
conclusions than the graphical analysis, then some effort should be
invested to explain why.  Often this is an indication that some of the
assumptions of the classical techniques are violated.
<p>
Many of the quantitative techniques fall into two broad categories:
<ol>
   <li>Interval estimation</li>
   <li>Hypothesis tests</li>
</ol>

Interval Estimates

</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%>
<!-- Add main text below -->
It is common in statistics to estimate a parameter
from a sample of data.  The value of the parameter using all of the
possible data, not just the sample data, is called the population
parameter or true value of the parameter.  An estimate of the
true parameter value is made using the sample data.  This
is called a point estimate or a sample estimate.
<p>
For example, the most commonly used measure of location is the
mean.  The population, or true, mean is the sum of all the 
members of the given population divided by the number of members
in the population.  As it is typically impractical to measure
every member of the population, a random sample is drawn from
the population.  The sample mean is calculated by
summing the values in the sample and dividing by the number
of values in the sample.  This sample mean is then used as the point
estimate of the population mean.
<p>
Interval estimates expand on point estimates by incorporating
the uncertainty of the point estimate.
In the example for the mean above, different samples from the
same population will generate different values for the sample
mean.  An interval estimate quantifies this uncertainty
in the sample estimate by computing lower and upper values
of an interval which will, with a given level of confidence
(i.e., probability), contain the population parameter.

Hypothesis Tests
</A>

</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=85%>
<!-- Add main text below -->
Hypothesis tests also address the uncertainty of the sample
estimate.  However, instead of providing an interval, a
hypothesis test attempts to refute a specific claim about a
population parameter based on the sample data.  For example,
the hypothesis might be one of the following:
<ul>
   <li>the population mean is equal to 10</li>
   <li>the population standard deviation is equal to 5</li>
   <li>the means from two populations are equal</li>
   <li>the standard deviations from 5 populations are equal</li>
</ul>
<p>
To reject a hypothesis is to conclude that it is
false.  However, to accept a hypothesis does not mean that
it is true, only that we do not have evidence to
believe otherwise.  Thus hypothesis tests are usually stated in
terms of both a condition that is doubted (null hypothesis)
and a condition that is believed (alternative hypothesis).
<p>
A common format for a hypothesis test is:
<table>
   <tr>
      <td valign=top>
         H<sub>0</sub>:
      </td>
      <td valign=top>
         A statement of the null hypothesis, e.g., two population
         means are equal.
      </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td valign=top>
         H<sub>a</sub>: 
      </td>
      <td valign=top>
         A statement of the alternative hypothesis, e.g., two
         population means are not equal.
      </td>
   </tr>
   <p>
   <tr>
      <td valign=top>
         Test Statistic: 
      </td>
      <td valign=top>
         The test statistic is based on the specific hypothesis test.
      </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <A NAME="POWER">
      <td valign=top>
         Significance Level: 
      </td>
      </A>
      <td valign=top>
         The significance level, &alpha;,
         <!--<img src="eqns/alpha.gif" alt="alpha">, -->
         defines the sensitivity of the test.  A value of
         <!-- <img src="eqns/alpha.gif" alt="alpha"> --> &alpha;
         = 0.05 means that we inadvertently reject the null hypothesis
         5% of the time when it is in fact true.  This is also called
         the type I error.  The choice of
         <!-- <img src="eqns/alpha.gif" alt="alpha"> --> &alpha;
         is somewhat arbitrary, although in practice values of 0.1,
         0.05, and 0.01 are commonly used.
         <p>
         The probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is
         in fact false is called the power of the test and is
         denoted by 1 -
         <!-- <img align=absmiddle src="eqns/beta.gif" alt="beta"> -->
         &beta;.  Its complement, the probability of accepting
         the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is, in
         fact, true (type II error), is called
         <!-- <img align=absmiddle src="eqns/beta.gif" alt="beta"> -->
         &beta; and can only be computed for a specific alternative
         hypothesis.
      </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td valign=top>
         Critical Region: 
      </td>
      <td valign=top>
         The critical region encompasses those values of the test
         statistic that lead to a rejection of the null hypothesis.
         Based on the distribution of the test statistic and
         the significance level, a cut-off value for the test
         statistic is computed.  Values either above or below or
         both (depending on the direction of the test) this
         cut-off define the critical region.

Practical Versus Statistical Significance
</I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%>
<!-- Add main text below -->
It is important to distinguish between statistical significance and
practical significance.  Statistical significance simply means
that we reject the null hypothesis.  The ability of the test to
detect differences that lead to rejection of the null hypothesis
depends on the sample size.  For example, for a particularly large
sample, the test may reject the null hypothesis that two process means
are equivalent.  However, in practice the difference between the two
means may be relatively small to the point of having no real
engineering significance.  Similarly, if the sample size is small, a
difference that is large in engineering terms may not lead to
rejection of the null hypothesis.  The analyst should not just
blindly apply the tests, but should combine engineering judgement with
statistical analysis.

Bootstrap Uncertainty Estimates

<!-- Add main text below -->
In some cases, it is possible to mathematically derive appropriate
uncertainty intervals.  This is particularly true for intervals based
on the assumption of a normal distribution.  However, there are many
cases in which it is not possible to mathematically derive the
uncertainty.  In these cases, the <a href="bootplot.html">bootstrap</a>
provides a method for empirically determining an appropriate interval.

Purpose: <br>
Check to determine

</I>
</TD>

<TD WIDTH=85% valign=top>
The block plot (<a href="../section4/eda43.html#Filliben">Filliben
1993</a>) is an EDA tool for assessing whether the factor of interest
(the primary factor) has a statistically significant effect on the
response, and whether that conclusion about the primary factor effect
is valid robustly over all other nuisance or secondary factors in
the experiment.
<P>
It replaces the <a href="../../prc/section4/prc42.html">analysis of
variance test</a> with a less assumption-dependent binomial test
and should be routinely used whenever we are trying to robustly
decide whether a primary factor has an effect.

<P>
This block plot reveals that in 10 of the 12 cases (bars), weld
method 2 is lower (better) than weld method 1.  From a binomial
point of view, weld method is statistically significant.

Definition

<TD WIDTH=85% valign=top>
Block Plots are formed as follows:
<UL>
<li> Vertical axis: Response variable Y
<li> Horizontal axis: All combinations of all levels
     of all nuisance (secondary) factors X1, X2, ...
<li> Plot Character: Levels of the primary factor XP

Primary factor is denoted by plot character: within-bar plot character.

<TD WIDTH=85% valign=top>
Average number of defective lead wires per hour from a study with
four factors,
<ol>
   <li> weld strength (2 levels)
   <li> plant (2 levels)
   <li> speed (2 levels)
   <li> shift (3 levels)
</ol>
are shown in the plot above.  Weld strength is the primary factor and
the other three factors are nuisance factors.  The 12 distinct
positions along the horizontal axis correspond to all possible
combinations of the three nuisance factors, i.e.,  12 = 2 plants x 
2 speeds x 3 shifts.  These 12 conditions provide the framework for
assessing whether any conclusions about the 2 levels of the primary
factor (weld method) can truly be called "general conclusions".  If
we find that one weld method setting does better (smaller average
defects per hour) than the other weld method setting for all or most
of these 12 nuisance factor combinations, then the
conclusion is in fact general and robust.

In the above chart, the ordering along the horizontal axis is as
follows:
<ul>
   <li>The left 6 bars are from plant 1 and the right 6
       bars are from plant 2.
   <li>The first 3 bars are from speed 1, the next 3 bars are from
       speed 2, the next 3 bars are from speed 1, and the last 3 bars
       are from speed 2.
   <li>Bars 1, 4, 7, and 10 are from the first shift,
       bars 2, 5, 8, and 11 are from the second shift, and
       bars 3, 6, 9, and 12 are from the third shift.

Setting 2 is better than setting 1 in 10 out of 12 cases
</I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%>
<!-- Add main text below -->
In the block plot for the first bar (plant 1, speed 1, shift 1),
weld method 1 yields about 28 defects per hour while weld method 2
yields about 22 defects per hour--hence the difference for this
combination is about 6 defects per hour and weld method 2
is seen to be better (smaller number of defects per hour).
<p>
Is "weld method 2 is better than weld method 1" a general
conclusion?
<p>
For the second bar (plant 1, speed 1, shift 2), weld method 1 is 
about 37 while weld method 2 is only about 18.  Thus weld method 2 is
again seen to be better than weld method 1.  Similarly for bar 3
(plant 1, speed 1, shift 3), we see weld method 2 is smaller than weld
method 1.  Scanning over all of the 12 bars, we see that
weld method 2 is smaller than weld method 1 in 10 of the 12 cases,
which is highly suggestive of a robust weld method effect.

<!-- Add main text below -->
What is the chance of 10 out of 12 happening by chance? This is
probabilistically equivalent to testing whether a coin is fair by
flipping it and getting 10 heads in 12 tosses.  The chance 
(<a href="eda366i.html">from the binomial distribution</a>) of getting
10 (or more extreme: 11, 12) heads in 12 flips of a fair coin is
about 2%.  Such low-probability events are usually rejected as
untenable and in practice we would conclude that there is a difference
in weld methods.

The advantages of the block plot are as follows:
<ul>
   <li>A quantitative procedure (analysis of variance) is replaced
       by a graphical procedure.
   <li>An F-test (analysis of variance) is replaced with a binomial
       test, which requires fewer assumptions.

<TD WIDTH=85% valign=top>
The block plot can provide answers to the following questions:
<OL>
   <li> Is the factor of interest significant?
   <li> Does the factor of interest have an effect?
   <li> Does the location change between levels of the
        primary factor?
   <li> Has the process improved?
   <li> What is the best setting (= level) of the primary factor?
   <li> How much of an average improvement can we expect
        with this best setting of the primary factor?
   <li> Is there an interaction between the primary factor
        and one or more nuisance factors?
   <li> Does the effect of the primary factor change
        depending on the setting of some nuisance factor?
   <li> Are there any outliers?
</OL>

Importance: <br>
Robustly checks the significance of the factor of interest
</I>
</TD>

<TD WIDTH=85% valign=top>
The block plot is a graphical technique that pointedly focuses on
whether or not the primary factor conclusions are in fact robustly
general.  This question is fundamentally different from the generic
multi-factor experiment question where the analyst asks, "What factors
are important and what factors are not" (a screening problem)?  Global
data analysis techniques, such as analysis of variance, can
potentially be improved by local, focused data analysis techniques
that take advantage of this difference.

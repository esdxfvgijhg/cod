Purpose:<br>
Check Underlying Statistical Assumptions
</I>
</TD>

<td width=85%>
The 4-plot is a collection of 4 specific EDA graphical techniques
whose purpose is to test the assumptions that underlie most
measurement processes.  A 4-plot consists of a
<ol>
   <li><a href="runseqpl.html">run sequence plot</a>;
   <li><a href="lagplot.html">lag plot</a>;
   <li><a href="histogra.html">histogram</a>;
   <li><a href="normprpl.html">normal probability plot</a>.
</ol>
If the <a href="../section2/eda21.html">4 underlying assumptions</a>
of a typical measurement process hold, then the above 4 plots will
have a characteristic appearance (see the
normal random numbers case study below); if any of the underlying
assumptions fail to hold, then it will be revealed by an anomalous
appearance in one or more of the plots.  Several commonly encountered
situations are demonstrated in the case studies below.
<p>
Although the 4-plot has an obvious use for univariate and time series
data, its usefulness extends far beyond that.  Many statistical
<a href="../../pmd/pmd.html">models</a> of the form
<ul>
   <!--
   <img src="eqns/funmodel.gif"
        alt="Y(i) = f(X1, ..., Xk) + E(i)">
   -->
   \[ Y_{i} = f(X_{1}, ... , X_{k}) + E_{i} \]
</ul>
have the same underlying assumptions for the error term.  That is,
no matter how complicated the functional fit, the assumptions on
the underlying error term are still the same.  The 4-plot can and
should be routinely applied to the residuals when fitting models
regardless of whether the model is simple or complicated.

<!-----begin section: importance -->

<TR>

<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top>
<I>
Importance:<br>
Testing Underlying Assumptions Helps Ensure the Validity
of the Final Scientific and Engineering Conclusions
</I>
</TD>

<TD WIDTH=85%>
There are 4 assumptions that typically underlie all measurement
processes; namely, that the data from the process at hand
"behave like":
<ol>
   <li>random drawings;
   <li>from a fixed distribution;
   <li>with that distribution having a fixed location; and
   <li>with that distribution having fixed variation.
</ol>
Predictability is an all-important goal in science and engineering.
If the above 4 assumptions hold, then we have achieved probabilistic
predictability--the ability to make probability statements not only
about the process in the past, but also about the process in the
future.  In short, such processes are said to be "statistically in
control".  If the 4 assumptions do not hold, then we have a process
that is drifting (with respect to location, variation, or
distribution), is unpredictable, and is out of control.  A simple
characterization of such processes by a location estimate, a variation
estimate, or a distribution "estimate" inevitably leads to optimistic
and grossly invalid engineering conclusions.
<p>
Inasmuch as the validity of the final scientific and engineering
conclusions is inextricably linked to the validity of these same 4
underlying assumptions, it naturally follows that there is a real
necessity for all 4 assumptions to be routinely tested.  The 4-plot
(run sequence plot, lag plot, histogram, and normal probability plot)
is seen as a simple, efficient, and powerful way of carrying out this
routine checking.

<!-----begin section: interpretation -->

<TR>
<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top>
<I>
Interpretation:<br>
Flat, Equi-Banded, Random, Bell-Shaped, and Linear
</I>
</TD>

<td width=85%>
Of the 4 underlying assumptions:
<ol>
   <li>If the fixed location assumption holds, then the run sequence
       plot will be flat and non-drifting.
   <li>If the fixed variation assumption holds, then the vertical
       spread in the run sequence plot will be approximately the
       same over the entire horizontal axis.
   <li>If the randomness assumption holds, then the lag plot will be
       structureless and random.
   <li>If the fixed distribution assumption holds (in particular, if
       the fixed normal distribution assumption holds), then the
       histogram will be bell-shaped and the normal probability plot
       will be approximatelylinear.
</ol>
If all 4 of the assumptions hold, then the process is "statistically
in control".  In practice, many processes fall short of achieving this
ideal.

<!-- Add main text below -->
We want to select the most appropriate model to represent our data.
This requires balancing the following two goals.
<ol>
   <li>We want the model to include all important factors.
   <li>We want the model to be parsimonious.  That is, the model
       should be as simple as possible.
</ol>
In short, we want our model to include all the important factors
and interactions and to omit the unimportant factors and
interactions.
<p>
Seven criteria are utilized to define important factors.  These seven
criteria are not all equally important, nor will they yield identical
subsets, in which case a consensus subset or a weighted consensus
subset must be extracted.  In practice, some of these criteria
may not apply in all situations.
<p>
These criteria will be examined in the context of the
<a href="../../pri/section6/pri611.html">eddy current</a>
data set.  The parameter estimates computed using least-squares analysis
are shown below.
<p>

</PRE>
<P>
In practice, not all of these criteria will be used with every
analysis (and some analysts may have additional criteria).  These
critierion are given as useful guidelines.  Most analysts will focus
on those criteria that they find most useful.

The seven criteria that we can use in determining whether to
keep a factor in the model can be summarized as follows.

</OL>
The first four criteria focus on parameter estimates with 
three numeric criteria and one graphical criteria.
The fifth criteria focuses on effects, which are twice the parameter
estimates.  The last two criteria
focus on the residual standard deviation of the model.  We
discuss each of these seven criteria in detail in the sections 
that following.

&Delta; is the minimum engineering significant difference.
<P>
That is, declare a factor as "important" if the parameter estimate 
is greater than some a priori declared engineering difference.  This
implies that the engineering staff have in fact stated what a
minimum difference will be.  Oftentimes this is not the case.  In
the absence of an a priori difference, a good rough rule for
the minimum engineering significant
<!--<img align=absmiddle src="eqns/delta.gif" alt="delta"> -->
&Delta; is to keep only those factors whose parameter estimate is greater
than, say, 10% of the current production average.  In this case, let's say
that the average detector has a sensitivity of 2.5 ohms.  This
would suggest that we would declare all factors whose parameter is
greater than 10 % of 2.5 ohms = 0.25 ohm to be significant
(from an engineering point of view).
<p>
Based on this minimum engineering significant difference criterion,
we conclude that we should  keep two terms: X1 and X2.

That is, exclude any factor that is less than 10 % of the maximum
parameter size.  We may or may not keep the other factors. This
criterion is neither engineering nor statistical, but it does offer
some additional numerical insight.  For the current example, the
largest parameter is from X1 (1.55125 ohms), and so 10 % of that
is 0.155 ohms, which suggests keeping all factors whose parameters
exceed 0.155 ohms.
<P>
Based on the order-of-magnitude criterion, we thus conclude that we
should keep two terms:  X1 and X2.  A third term, X2*X3
(0.14875), is just slightly under the cutoff level, so we may
consider keeping it based on the other criterion.

   \( |\hat{\beta_i}| > 2 \cdot \mbox{s.e.}(\hat{\beta_i}) \)
</UL>
That is, declare a factor as important if its parameter is more
than 2 standard deviations away from 0 (0, by definition, meaning
"no effect").
<P>
The "2" comes from normal theory (more specifically,
a value of 1.96 yields a 95 % confidence interval).  More precise
values would come from <i>t</i>-distribution theory.
<P>
The difficulty with this is that in order to invoke this criterion
we need the standard deviation,
<!-- <img align=absmiddle src="eqns/sigma.gif" alt="sigma">, -->
<i>&sigma;</i> of an observation.  This is problematic because
<ol>
   <li>the engineer may not know
       <!-- <img align=absmiddle src="eqns/sigma.gif" alt="sigma">; -->
       <i>&sigma;</i>;
   <li>the experiment might not have replication, and so a
       model-free estimate of
       <!-- <img align=absmiddle src="eqns/sigma.gif" alt="sigma"> -->
       <i>&sigma;</i> is not obtainable;
   <li>obtaining an estimate of
       <!-- <img align=absmiddle src="eqns/sigma.gif" alt="sigma"> -->
       <i>&sigma;</i> by assuming the sometimes employed assumption of
       ignoring 3-term interactions and higher may be incorrect from an
       engineering point of view.
</ol>
For the eddy current example:
<ol>
   <li>the engineer did <b>not</b> know
       <!-- <img align=absmiddle src="eqns/sigma.gif" alt="sigma">; -->
       <i>&sigma;</i>;
   <li>the design (a 2<sup>3</sup> full factorial) did <b>not</b>
       have replication;
   <li>ignoring 3-term interactions and higher interactions leads to
       an estimate of
       <!-- <img align=absmiddle src="eqns/sigma.gif" alt="sigma"> -->
       <i>&sigma;</i> based on omitting only a single term: the
       X1*X2*X3 interaction.
</ol>
For the eddy current example, if one assumes that the 3-term
interaction is nil and hence represents a single drawing from a
population centered at zero, then an estimate of the standard
deviation of a parameter is simply the estimate of the 3-factor
interaction (0.07125).  Two standard deviations is
thus 0.1425.  For this example, the rule is thus to keep all
<!--
<img align=absmiddle src="eqns/absbeta.gif"
   alt="absolute value of betai"> > 0.1425.
-->
\( |\hat{\beta_{i}}| \)
<P>
This results in keeping three terms: X1 (1.55125), X2 (-0.43375),
and X1*X2 (0.14875).

can be used in the following manner.
<ol>
   <li>Normal Probability Plot: Keep a factor as "important" if it
       is well off the line through zero on a normal probability
       plot of the parameter estimates.
       <p>
   <li>Half-Normal Probability Plot: Keep a factor as "important"
       if it is well off the line near zero on a half-normal
       probability plot of the absolute value of parameter estimates.
</ol>
Both of these methods are based on the fact that the least-squares
estimates of parameters for these two-level orthogonal designs are
simply half the difference of averages and so the central limit theorem,
loosely applied, suggests that (if no factor were important) the
parameter estimates should have approximately a normal distribution with
mean zero and the absolute value of the estimates should have a
half-normal distribution.
<p>
Since the half-normal probability plot is only concerned with parmeter
magnitudes as opposed to signed parameters (which are subject to the
vagaries of how the initial factor codings +1 and -1 were assigned),
the half-normal probability plot is preferred by some over the normal
probability plot.

For the example at hand, the probability plot clearly shows
two factors (X1 and X2) displaced off the line.  All of the remaining 
five parameters are behaving like random drawings from a normal distribution 
centered at zero, and so are deemed to be statistically non-significant.  
In conclusion, this rule keeps two factors: X1 (1.55125) and X2 (-0.43375).

A <a href="youdplot.html">Youden plot</a> can
be used in the following way.  Keep a factor as "important" if it
is displaced away from the central-tendancy "bunch" in a Youden
plot of high and low averages.  By definition, a factor is
important when its average response for the low (-1) setting is
significantly different from its average response for the high (+1)
setting.  (Note that effects are twice the parameter estimates.)  
Conversely, if the low and high averages are about the
same, then what difference does it make which setting to use and
so why would such a factor be considered important?  This fact in
combination with the intrinsic benefits of the Youden plot for
comparing pairs of items leads to the technique of generating a
Youden plot of the low and high averages.

Residual Standard Deviation: Engineering Significance
</I>
</A>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%>
<!-- Add main text below -->
This criterion is defined as
<UL>
    Residual Standard Deviation > Cutoff
</UL>
That is, declare a factor as "important" if the cumulative model
that includes the factor (and all larger factors) has a residual
standard deviation smaller than an a priori engineering-specified
minimum residual standard deviation.  
<p>
This criterion is different from the others in that it is
model focused.  In practice, this criterion states that starting
with the largest parameter, we cumulatively keep adding terms to 
the model and monitor how the residual standard deviation for each 
progressively more complicated model becomes smaller.  At
some point, the cumulative model will become complicated enough and
comprehensive enough that the resulting residual standard deviation
will drop below the pre-specified engineering cutoff for the
residual standard deviation.  At that point, we stop adding terms
and declare all of the model-included terms to be "important" and
everything not in the model to be "unimportant".
<p>
This approach implies that the engineer has considered what a
minimum residual standard deviation should be.  In effect, this
relates to what the engineer can tolerate for the magnitude of the
typical residual (the difference between the raw data and the
predicted value from the model).  In other words, how good does
the engineer want the prediction equation to be.  Unfortunately,
this engineering specification has not always been formulated
and so this criterion can become moot.
<p>
In the absence of a prior specified cutoff, a good rough rule for
the minimum engineering residual standard deviation is to keep
adding terms until the residual standard deviation just dips
below, say, 5 % of the current production average.  For the eddy current
data, let's say that the average detector has a sensitivity of
2.5 ohms.  Then this would suggest that we would keep adding
terms to the model until the residual standard deviation falls
below 5 % of 2.5 ohms = 0.125 ohms.

</pre>

Based on the minimum residual standard deviation criteria, and
we would include <b>all</b> terms in order to drive the
residual standard deviation below 0.125.  Again, the 5 % rule is a
rough-and-ready rule that has no basis in engineering or
statistics, but is simply a "numerics".  Ideally, the engineer has
a better cutoff for the residual standard deviation that is based
on how well he/she wants the equation to peform in practice.  If
such a number were available, then for this criterion and data set
we would select something less than the entire collection of terms.

Such conflicting results are common.  Arguably, the three most
important criteria (listed in order of most important) are:

Scanning all of the above, we thus declare the following consensus
for the eddy current data:
<ol>
   <li>Important Factors: X1 and X2
   <li>Parsimonious Prediction Equation:
       <P>
       <UL>

          \( \hat{Y} = 2.65875 + 1.55125 \cdot X_1 - 0.43375 \cdot X_2 \)
       </UL>
       <P>
       (with a residual standard deviation of 0.30429 ohms)
</ol>
Note that this is the initial model selection.  We still need
to perform model validation with a residual analysis.

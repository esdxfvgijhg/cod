<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top>
<I>
Purpose: <br>
Check pairwise relationship between two variables conditional
on a third variable
</I>
</TD>

<TD WIDTH=85% valign=top>
A conditioning plot, also known as a coplot or subset plot,
is a plot of two variables conditional on the value of a third
variable (called the conditioning variable).  The conditioning
variable may be either a variable that takes on only a few
discrete values or a continuous variable that is divided into
a limited number of subsets.
<P>
One limitation of the <a href="scatplma.html">scatterplot matrix</a>
is that it cannot show interaction effects with another variable.
This is the strength of the conditioning plot.  It is also useful
for displaying scatter plots for groups in the data.  Although
these groups can also be plotted on a single plot with different
plot symbols, it can often be visually easier to distinguish the
groups using the conditioning plot.
<P>
Although the basic concept of the conditioning plot matrix is simple,
there are numerous alternatives in the details of the plots.
<OL>
   <LI>It can be helpful to overlay some type of fitted curve
       on the scatter plot.  Although a linear or quadratic fit
       can be used, the most common alternative is to overlay
       a <a href="../../pmd/section1/pmd144.html">lowess</a>
       curve.
       <P>
   <LI>Due to the potentially large number of plots, it can be
       somewhat tricky to provide the axis labels in a way that is
       both informative and visually pleasing.  One alternative that
       seems to work well is to provide axis labels on alternating
       rows and columns.  That is, row one will have tic marks
       and axis labels on the left vertical axis for the first
       plot only while row two will have the tic marks and axis
       labels for the right vertical axis for the last plot in the
       row only.  This alternating pattern continues for the
       remaining rows.  A similar pattern is used for the columns
       and the horizontal axis labels.  Note that this approach only
       works if the axes limits are fixed to common values for all
       of the plots.
       <P>
   <LI>Some analysts prefer to connect the scatter plots.  Others
       prefer to leave a little gap between each plot.  Alternatively,
       each plot can have its own labeling with the plots not
       connected.
       <P>
   <LI>Although this plot type is most commonly used for scatter
       plots, the basic concept is both simple and powerful and
       extends easily to other plot formats.

<P>
In this case, temperature has six distinct values.  We plot torque
versus time for each of these temperatures.  This example is
discussed in more detail in the

Definition

<TD WIDTH=85% valign=top>
Given the variables <b><i>X</i></b>, <b><i>Y</i></b>, and
<b><i>Z</i></b>, the conditioning plot is formed by dividing the values
of <b><i>Z</i></b> into <i>k</i> groups.  There are several ways that
these groups may be formed.  There may be a natural grouping of the
data, the data may be divided into several equal sized groups, the
grouping may be determined by clusters in the data, and so on.  The
page will be divided into <i>n</i> rows and <i>c</i> columns where
<i>nc</i> &ge; <i>k</i>.
Each row and column defines a single scatter plot.
<P>
The individual plot for row <i>i</i> and column <i>j</i> is defined as
<UL>
   <li>Vertical axis: Variable <b><i>Y</i></b>
   <li>Horizontal axis: Variable <b><i>X</i></b>
</UL>
where only the points in the group corresponding to the <i>i</i>th
row and <i>j</i>th column are used.

<TD WIDTH=85% valign=top>
The conditioning plot can provide answers to the following
questions:
<OL>
   <LI>Is there a relationship between two variables?
   <LI>If there is a relationship, does the nature of the
       relationship depend on the value of a third variable?
   <LI>Are groups in the data similar?
   <LI>Are there outliers in the data?

<TD WIDTH=85% valign=top>
Conditioning plots are becoming increasingly common in general purpose
statistical software programs, including R and Dataplot.  If
a software program does not generate conditioning plots, but it
does provide multiple plots per page and scatter plots, it should
be possible to write a macro to generate a conditioning plot.

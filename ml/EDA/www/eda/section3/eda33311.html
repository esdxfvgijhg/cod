      The DOE (Design of Experiments) Youden plot is a specialized
      Youden plot used in the analysis of
      <a href="../../pri/section3/pri333.html">full</a> and
      <a href="../../pri/section3/pri334.html">fractional</a>
      experiment designs.  In particular, it is used in conjunction with the
      <a href="eda35i.html">Yates algorithm</a>.
      These designs may have a low level, coded as
      "-1" or "-", and a high level, coded as "+1" or "+", for each
      factor.  In addition, there can optionally be one or more
      center points.  Center points are at the midpoint between
      the low and high levels for each factor and are coded as "0".
      <P>
      The Yates agorithm and the the DOE Youden plot only use the
      "-1" and "+1" points.  The Yates agorithm is used to
      estimate factor effects.  The DOE Youden plot can be used
      to help determine the approriate model to based on the effect 
      estimates from the Yates algorithm.

      Construction of DOE Youden Plot

   </TD>
   <TD WIDTH=85%>
      The following are the primary steps in the construction
      of the DOE Youden plot.
      <P>
      <OL>
         <li>For a given factor or interaction term, compute the
             mean of the response variable for the low level
             of the factor and for the high level of the factor.
             Any center points are omitted from the computation.
             <P>
         <li>Plot the point where the <i>y</i>-coordinate is the mean
             for the high level of the factor and the
             <i>x</i>-coordinate is the mean for the low level of the
             factor.  The character used for the plot point should
             identify the factor or interaction term (e.g., "1" for
             factor 1, "13" for the interaction between factors 1 and
             3).
             <P>
         <li>Repeat steps 1 and 2 for each factor and interaction
             term of the data.
             <P>
      </OL>
      The high and low values of the interaction terms are obtained by
      multiplying the corresponding values of the main level factors.
      For example, the interaction term <i>X</i><sub>13</sub> is
      obtained by multiplying the values for <i>X</i><sub>1</sub> with
      the corresponding values of <i>X</i><sub>3</sub>.  Since the
      values for <i>X</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>X</i><sub>3</sub> are
      either "-1" or "+1", the resulting values for
      <i>X</i><sub>13</sub> are also either "-1" or "+1".
      <p>
      In summary, the DOE Youden plot is a plot of the mean
      of the response variable for the high level of a factor or
      interaction term against the mean of the response variable
      for the low level of that factor or interaction term.
      <P>
      For unimportant factors and interaction terms, these mean
      values should be nearly the same.  For important factors
      and interaction terms, these mean values should be quite
      different.  So the interpretation of the plot is that
      unimportant factors should be clustered together near the
      grand mean.  Points that stand apart from this cluster
      identify important factors that should be included in the
      model.

      The following is a DOE Youden plot for the data used in the
      <a href="../../pri/section6/pri61.html">Eddy current</a> case
      study.  The analysis in that case study demonstrated that
      X1 and X2 were the most important factors.

   </td>
   <td width=85% valign=top>
      From the above DOE Youden plot, we see that factors 1 and 2
      stand out from the others.  That is, the mean
      response values for the low and high levels of factor 1 and
      factor 2 are quite different.  For factor 3 and the 2 and 3-term
      interactions, the mean response values for the low and high
      levels are similar.
      <p>
      We would conclude from this plot that factors 1 and 2 are
      important and should be included in our final model while the
      remaining factors and interactions should be omitted from the
      final model.

      The <a href="../../pri/section6/pri611.html">Eddy current</a>
      case study demonstrates the use of the DOE Youden plot in the
      context of the analysis of a full factorial design.

      DOE Youden plots are not typically available as built-in
      plots in statistical software programs.  However, it should
      be relatively straightforward to write a macro to generate
      this plot in most general purpose statistical software
      programs.

Purpose: <br>
Check Pairwise Relationships Between Variables
</I>
</TD>

<TD WIDTH=85% valign=top>
Given a set of variables <b><i>X<sub>1</sub>, X<sub>2</sub>, ... ,
X<sub>k</sub></i></b>, the scatterplot matrix contains all
the pairwise scatter plots of the variables on a single page
in a matrix format.  That is, if there are <i>k</i> variables, the
scatterplot matrix will have <i>k</i> rows and <i>k</i> columns and
the <i>i</i>th row and <i>j</i>th column of this matrix is a plot of
<b><i>X<sub>i</sub></i></b> versus <b><i>X<sub>j</sub></i></b>.
<P>
Although the basic concept of the scatterplot matrix is simple,
there are numerous alternatives in the details of the plots.
<OL>
   <LI>The diagonal plot is simply a 45-degree line since we
       are plotting <b><i>X<sub>i</sub></i></b> versus
       <b><i>X<sub>i</sub></i></b>.  Although this has some
       usefulness in terms of showing the univariate distribution
       of the variable, other alternatives are common.  Some
       users prefer to use the diagonal to print the variable label.
       Another alternative is to plot the univariate histogram on
       the diagonal.  Alternatively, we could simply leave the
       diagonal blank.
       <P>
   <LI>Since <b><i>X<sub>i</sub></i></b> versus
       <b><i>X<sub>j</sub></i></b> is equivalent to
       <b><i>X<sub>j</sub></i></b> versus
       <b><i>X<sub>i</sub></i></b> with the axes reversed, some
       prefer to omit the plots below the diagonal.
       <P>
   <LI>It can be helpful to overlay some type of fitted curve
       on the scatter plot.  Although a linear or quadratic fit
       can be used, the most common alternative is to overlay
       a <a href="../../pmd/section1/pmd144.html">lowess</a>
       curve.
       <P>
   <LI>Due to the potentially large number of plots, it can be
       somewhat tricky to provide the axes labels in a way that is
       both informative and visually pleasing.  One alternative that
       seems to work well is to provide axis labels on alternating
       rows and columns.  That is, row one will have tic marks
       and axis labels on the left vertical axis for the first
       plot only while row two will have the tic marks and axis
       labels for the right vertical axis for the last plot in the
       row only.  This alternating pattern continues for the
       remaining rows.  A similar pattern is used for the columns
       and the horizontal axes labels.  Another alternative is to
       put the minimum and maximum scale value in the diagonal plot
       with the variable name.
       <P>
   <LI>Some analysts prefer to connect the scatter plots.  Others
       prefer to leave a little gap between each plot.
       <P>
   <LI>Although this plot type is most commonly used for scatter
       plots, the basic concept is both simple and powerful and
       extends easily to other plot formats that involve pairwise
       plots such as the
       <a href="qqplot.html">quantile-quantile plot</a> and the
       <a href="bihistog.html">bihistogram</a>.

This sample plot was generated from pollution data collected by
NIST chemist Lloyd Currie.
<P>
There are a number of ways to view this plot.  If we are primarily
interested in a particular variable, we can scan the row and column
for that variable.  If we are interested in finding the strongest
relationship, we can scan all the plots and then determine which
variables are related.

       relationships?
   <LI>Are there outliers in the data?
   <LI>Is there clustering by groups in the data?

<!-- Add main text below -->
The scatterplot matrix serves as the foundation for the
concepts of linking and brushing.
<P>
By linking, we mean showing how a point, or set of points, behaves
in each of the plots.  This is accomplished by highlighting these
points in some fashion.  For example, the highlighted points could
be drawn as a filled circle while the remaining points could be drawn
as unfilled circles.  A typical application of this would be to
show how an outlier shows up in each of the individual pairwise
plots.  Brushing extends this concept a bit further.  In brushing,
the points to be highlighted are interactively selected by a
mouse and the scatterplot matrix is dynamically updated (ideally
in real time).  That is, we can select a rectangular region of
points in one plot and see how those points are reflected in the
other plots.  Brushing is discussed in detail by Becker, Cleveland,
and Wilks in the paper <I>"Dynamic Graphics for Data Analysis"</I>
(<a href="../section4/eda43.html#Cleveland3">Cleveland and McGill,
1988</a>).

<TD WIDTH=85% valign=top>
Scatterplot matrices are becoming increasingly common in
general purpose statistical software programs.  If
a software program does not generate scatterplot matrices, but it
does provide multiple plots per page and scatter plots, it should
be possible to write a macro to generate a scatterplot matrix.
Brushing is available in a few of the general purpose statistical
software programs that emphasize graphical approaches.

      <I>Purpose:<br>
         Graphical Technique for Finding the Shape Parameter of
         a Distributional Family that Best Fits a Data Set
      </I>
   </td>
   <td width=85% valign=top>
     The probability plot correlation coefficient (PPCC) plot
     (<a href="../section4/eda43.html#PPCC">Filliben 1975</a>)
     is a graphical technique for identifying the
     <a href="eda363.html">shape parameter</a> for a
     distributional family that best describes the data set.
     This technique is appropriate for families, such as the
     Weibull, that are defined by a single shape parameter
     and <a href="eda364.html">location and scale parameters</a>,
     and it is not appropriate for distributions, such as the
     normal, that are defined only by location and scale
     parameters.
     <p>
     The PPCC plot is generated as follows.  For a series of values
     for the shape parameter, the correlation coefficient is
     computed for the <a href="probplot.html">probability
     plot</a> associated with a given value of the shape parameter.
     These correlation coefficients  are plotted against their
     corresponding shape parameters.
     The maximum correlation coefficient corresponds to the optimal
     value of the shape parameter.  For better precision, two
     iterations of the PPCC plot can be generated; the first is for
     finding the right neighborhood and the second is for fine
     tuning the estimate.
     <p>
     The PPCC plot is used first to find a good value of the
     shape parameter.  The
     <a href="probplot.html">probability plot</a> is then generated
     to find estimates of the location and scale parameters and in
     addition to provide a graphical assessment of the adequacy of
     the distributional fit.

     In addition to finding a good choice for estimating the shape
     parameter of a given distribution, the PPCC plot can be useful
     in deciding which distributional family is most
     appropriate.  For example, given a set of reliabilty data,
     you might generate PPCC plots for a Weibull, lognormal,
     gamma, and inverse Gaussian distributions, and possibly others,
     on a single
     page.  This one page would show the best value for the
     shape parameter for several distributions and would
     additionally indicate which of these distributional
     families provides the best fit (as measured by the
     maximum probability plot correlation coefficient).  That
     is, if the maximum PPCC value for the Weibull is 0.99 and
     only 0.94 for the lognormal, then we could reasonably
     conclude that the Weibull family is the better choice.

      Tukey-Lambda PPCC Plot for Symmetric Distributions
      </I>
   </td>
   <td width=85% valign=top>
     The <a href="eda366f.html">Tukey Lambda</a> PPCC plot, with shape
     parameter <i>&lambda;</i>, is particularly useful for symmetric
     distributions.  It indicates whether a distribution is short or long
     tailed and it can further indicate several common distributions.
     Specifically, 
     <ol>
         <li><i>&lambda;</i> = -1: distribution is approximately Cauchy
         <li><i>&lambda;</i> =  0: distribution is exactly logistic
         <li><i>&lambda;</i> = 0.14: distribution is approximately normal
         <li><i>&lambda;</i> = 0.5: distribution is U-shaped
         <li><i>&lambda;</i> = 1: distribution is exactly uniform
     </ol>
     If the Tukey Lambda PPCC plot gives a maximum value near
     0.14, we can reasonably conclude that the normal distribution
     is a good model for the data.  If the maximum value is
     less than 0.14, a  long-tailed distribution such as the double
     exponential or logistic would be a better choice.
     If the maximum value is near -1, this implies the selection of
     very long-tailed distribution, such as the Cauchy.  If the
     maximum value is greater than 0.14, this implies a
     short-tailed distribution such as the Beta or uniform.
     <p>
     The Tukey-Lambda PPCC plot is used to suggest an
     appropriate distribution.  You should follow-up with
     PPCC and probability plots of the appropriate alternatives.

      Use Judgement When Selecting An Appropriate Distributional

      </I>
   </td>
   <td width=85% valign=top>
     When comparing distributional models, do not simply choose
     the one with the maximum PPCC value.  In many cases, several
     distributional fits provide comparable PPCC values.  For
     example, a lognormal and Weibull may both fit a given set
     of reliability data quite well.  Typically, we would
     consider the complexity of the distribution.   That is, a 
     simpler distribution with a marginally smaller PPCC value
     may be preferred over a more complex distribution.  Likewise,
     there may be theoretical justification in terms of the
     underlying scientific model for preferring a distribution
     with a marginally smaller PPCC value in some cases.
     In other cases, we may not need to know if the distributional
     model is optimal, only that it is adequate for our purposes.
     That is, we may be able to use techniques designed for
     normally distributed data even if other distributions fit
     the data somewhat better.

      Many statistical analyses are based on distributional assumptions
      about the population from which the data have been obtained.
      However, distributional families can have
      radically different shapes depending on the value of the shape
      parameter.  Therefore, finding a reasonable choice for the shape
      parameter is a necessary step in the analysis.  In many analyses,
      finding a good distributional model for the data is the primary
      focus of the analysis.  In both of these cases, the PPCC plot
      is a valuable tool.

PPCC plots are currently not available in most common general purpose
statistical software programs.  However, the underlying technique
is based on probability plots and correlation coefficients, so
it should be possible to write macros for PPCC plots in statistical
programs that support these capabilities.
Dataplot supports PPCC plots.

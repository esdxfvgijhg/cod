<!-- Add main text below -->
A fundamental task in many statistical analyses is to characterize
the <a href="eda351.html"><I>location</I></A> and
<a href="eda356.html"><I>variability</I></A> of a data set.
A further characterization of the data includes skewness and kurtosis.
<p>
Skewness is a measure of symmetry, or more precisely, the lack of
symmetry.  A distribution, or data set, is symmetric if it looks the
same to the left and right of the center point.
<p>
<!-- 2016/02: Re-word following section based on suggestion
     from Peter Westfall
Kurtosis is a measure of whether the data are peaked or flat relative
to a normal distribution.  That is, data sets with high kurtosis
tend to have a distinct peak near the mean, decline rather rapidly,
and have heavy tails.  Data sets with low kurtosis tend to have
a flat top near the mean rather than a sharp peak.  A uniform
distribution would be the extreme case.
-->
Kurtosis is a measure of whether the data are heavy-tailed or
light-tailed relative to a normal distribution. That is, data sets
with high kurtosis tend to have heavy tails, or outliers. Data sets
with low kurtosis tend to have light tails, or lack of outliers. A
uniform distribution would be the extreme case.
<p>
The <a href="histogra.html">histogram</a> is an effective graphical
technique for showing both the skewness and kurtosis of data set.

<!-- Add main text below -->
For univariate data <i>Y</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>Y</i><sub>2</sub>, ...,
<i>Y<sub>N</sub></i>, the formula for skewness is:
<ul>
   <!--
   <img src="eqns/skewness.gif" alt=
        "skewness = SUM[i=1 to n][(Y(i) - YBAR)**3/(N-1)*s**3]">
   -->
   \[ g_{1} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}(Y_{i} - \bar{Y})^{3}/N} {s^{3}} \]
</ul>
where <!-- <img src="eqns/ybar.gif" alt="ybar"> --> \(\bar{Y}\) is the
mean, <b><i>s</i></b> <!-- <img src="eqns/s.gif" alt="s"> --> is the
standard deviation, and <i>N</i> is the number of data points.  Note that
in computing the skewness, the <i>s</i> is computed with <i>N</i> in the
denominator rather than <i>N</i> - 1.
<p>
The above formula for skewness is referred to as the Fisher-Pearson
coefficient of skewness. Many software programs actually compute the
adjusted Fisher-Pearson coefficient of skewness
<ul>
   \[ G_{1} = \frac{\sqrt{N(N-1)}}{N-1}
              \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}(Y_{i} - \bar{Y})^{3}/N} {s^{3}} \]
</ul>
This is an adjustment for sample size.  The adjustment approaches
1 as <i>N</i> gets large.  For reference, the adjustment factor is
1.49 for <i>N</i> = 5, 1.19 for <i>N</i> = 10, 1.08 for <i>N</i> = 20,
1.05 for <i>N</i> = 30, and 1.02 for <i>N</i> = 100.
<p>
The skewness for a <a href="eda3661.html">normal distribution</a> is zero,
and any symmetric data should have a skewness near zero.  Negative values
for the skewness indicate data that are skewed left and positive values for
the skewness indicate data that are skewed right.  By skewed left, we
mean that the left tail is long relative to the right tail.  Similarly,
skewed right means that the right tail is long relative to the left tail.
If the data are multi-modal, then this may affect the sign of the
skewness.
<p>
Some measurements have a lower bound and are skewed right.  For
example, in reliability studies, failure times cannot be negative.
<p>
It should be noted that there are alternative definitions of skewness in
the literature.  For example, the Galton skewness (also known as
Bowley's skewness) is defined as
<ul>
   \[ \mbox{Galton skewness} =
              \frac{Q_{1} + Q_{3} -2 Q_{2}}{Q_{3} - Q_{1}} \]
</ul>
where <i>Q</i><sub>1</sub> is the lower quartile, <i>Q</i><sub>3</sub>
is the upper quartile, and <i>Q</i><sub>2</sub> is the median.
<p>
The Pearson 2 skewness coefficient is defined as
<ul>
   \[ S_{k_2} = 3 \frac{(\bar{Y} - \tilde{Y})}{s} \]
</ul>
where \( \tilde{Y} \) is the sample median.
<p>
There are many other definitions for skewness that will not be
discussed here.

<ul>
   <!--

      {s^{4}} \]

Alternative Definition of Kurtosis
</I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%>
<!-- Add main text below -->
The kurtosis for a <a href="eda3661.html">standard normal
distribution</a> is three.  For this reason, some sources
use the following definition of kurtosis (often referred to as
"excess kurtosis"):
<ul>
   <!--
   <img src="eqns/kurtosi2.gif" alt=
        "kurtosis = SUM[i=1 to N][(Y(i) - YBAR)**4]/((N-1)*s**4) - 3">
   -->
   \[ \mbox{kurtosis} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}(Y_{i} - \bar{Y})^{4}/N}
      {s^{4}}  - 3 \]
</ul>
This definition is used so that the standard normal distribution
has a kurtosis of zero.  In addition, with the second definition
positive kurtosis indicates a "heavy-tailed" distribution and negative
kurtosis indicates a "light tailed" distribution.
<p>
Which definition of kurtosis is used is a matter of convention
(this handbook uses the original definition).  When using software to
compute the sample kurtosis, you need to be aware of which convention
is being followed.  Many sources use the term kurtosis when they are
actually computing "excess kurtosis", so it may not always be clear.

The first histogram is a sample from a
<a href="eda3661.html">normal distribution</a>.  The normal
distribution is a symmetric distribution with well-behaved tails.
This is indicated by the skewness of 0.03.  The kurtosis of 2.96 is
near the expected value of 3.  The histogram verifies the symmetry.

<!-- Add main text below -->
The second histogram is a sample from a
<a href="eda366c.html">double exponential distribution</a>.  The
double exponential is a symmetric distribution.
Compared to the normal, it has a stronger peak, more rapid decay,
and heavier tails.  That is, we would expect a skewness near zero
and a kurtosis higher than 3.  The skewness is 0.06 and the kurtosis
is 5.9.

Cauchy Distribution
</I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%>
<!-- Add main text below -->
The third histogram is a sample from a
<a href="eda3663.html">Cauchy distribution</a>.
<P>
For better visual comparison with the other data sets, we restricted
the histogram of the Cauchy distribution to values between -10 and
10.  The full data set for the Cauchy data in fact has a minimum of
approximately -29,000 and a maximum of approximately 89,000.
<p>
The Cauchy distribution is a symmetric distribution with heavy
tails and a single peak at the center of the distribution.
Since it is symmetric, we would expect a skewness near zero.
Due to the heavier tails, we might expect the kurtosis to be 
larger than for a normal distribution.
In fact the skewness is 69.99 and the kurtosis is 6,693.
These extremely high values can be explained by the heavy tails.
Just as the mean and standard deviation can be distorted by
extreme values in the tails, so too can the skewness and kurtosis
measures.

Weibull Distribution

</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%>
<!-- Add main text below -->
The fourth histogram is a sample from a
<a href="eda3668.html">Weibull distribution</a> with
shape parameter 1.5.  The Weibull distribution is a skewed distribution
with the amount of skewness depending on the value of the shape
parameter.  The degree of decay as we move away from the center also
depends on the value of the shape parameter.
For this data set, the skewness is 1.08 and the kurtosis
is 4.46, which indicates moderate skewness and kurtosis.

Dealing with Skewness and Kurtosis
</I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%>
<!-- Add main text below -->
Many classical statistical tests and intervals
depend on normality assumptions.  Significant skewness and
kurtosis clearly indicate that data are not normal.
If a data set exhibits significant skewness or kurtosis (as
indicated by a histogram or the numerical measures), what can
we do about it?
<p>
One approach is to apply some type of transformation to try
to make the data normal, or more nearly normal.  The 
<a href="boxcoxno.html">Box-Cox transformation</a> is a useful
technique for trying to normalize a data set.  In particular, taking
the log or square root of a data set is often useful for data that
exhibit moderate right skewness.
<p>
Another approach is to use techniques based on distributions
other than the normal.  For example, in reliability studies, the
exponential, Weibull, and lognormal distributions are typically
used as a basis for modeling rather than using the normal distribution.
The <a href="ppccplot.html">probability plot correlation coefficient
plot</a> and the <a href="probplot.html">probability plot</a> are
useful tools for determining a good distributional model for the
data.

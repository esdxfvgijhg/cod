      <I>Introduction</I>
   </td>
   <td width=85% valign=top>
      An outlier is an observation that appears to deviate markedly from
      other observations in the sample.
      <p>
      Identification of potential outliers is important for the following
      reasons.
      <ol>
         <li>An outlier may indicate bad data.  For example, the data
             may have been coded incorrectly or an experiment may
             not have been run correctly.  If it can be determined
             that an outlying point is in fact erroneous, then the
             outlying value should be deleted from the analysis (or
             corrected if possible).
             <p>
         <li>In some cases, it may not be possible to determine if an
             outlying point is bad data.  Outliers may be due to
             random variation or may indicate something scientifically
             interesting.  In any event, we typically do not want to
             simply delete the outlying observation.  However, if the
             data contains significant outliers, we may need to consider
             the use of robust statistical techniques.
      </ol>

      distinguish the three following issues with regards to outliers.
      <ol>
         <li>outlier labeling - flag potential outliers for further
             investigation (i.e., are the potential outliers erroneous
             data, indicative of an inappropriate distributional
             model, and so on).
             <p>
         <li>outlier accomodation - use robust statistical techniques
             that will not be unduly affected by outliers.  That is, if
             we cannot determine that potential outliers are erroneous
             observations, do we need modify our statistical analysis
             to more appropriately account for these observations?
             <p>
         <li>outlier identification - formally test whether observations
             are outliers.
      </ol>
      This section focuses on the labeling and identification issues.

      <A NAME="Normality">
      <I>Normality Assumption</I>
      </A>
   </td>
   <td width=85% valign=top>
      Identifying an observation as an outlier depends on the underlying
      distribution of the data.  In this section, we limit the discussion
      to univariate data sets that are assumed to follow an approximately
      normal distribution.  If the normality assumption for the data being
      tested is not valid, then a determination that there is an outlier
      may in fact be due to the non-normality of the data rather than the
      prescence of an outlier.
      <p>
      For this reason, it is recommended that you generate a
      <a href="normprpl.html">normal probability plot</a> of the data before
      applying an outlier test.  Although you can also perform formal tests
      for normality, the prescence of one or more outliers may cause the
      tests to reject normality when it is in fact a reasonable assumption
      for applying the outlier test.
      <p>
      In addition to checking the normality assumption, the lower and upper
      tails of the normal probability plot can be a useful graphical
      technique for identifying potential outliers. In particular, the plot
      can help determine whether we need to check for a single outlier or
      whether we need to check for multiple outliers.
      <p>
      The <a href="boxplot.html">box plot</a> and the
      <a href="histogra.html">histogram</a> can also be useful graphical
      tools in checking the normality assumption and in identifying
      potential outliers.

      <A NAME="MultipleOutliers">
      <I>Single Versus Multiple Outliers</I>
      </A>
   </td>
   <td width=85% valign=top>
      Some outlier tests are designed to detect the prescence of a
      single outlier while other tests are designed to detect the
      prescence of multiple outliers.  It is not appropriate to apply
      a test for a single outlier sequentially in order to detect
      multiple outliers.
      <p>
      In addition, some tests that detect multiple outliers may
      require that you specify the number of suspected outliers
      exactly.

   <td width=15% valign=top>
      <A NAME="MaskingSwamping">
      <I>Masking and Swamping</I>
      </A>
   </td>
   <td width=85% valign=top>
      Masking can occur when we specify too few outliers in the test. For
      example, if we are testing for a single outlier when there are in
      fact two (or more) outliers, these additional outliers may influence
      the value of the test statistic enough so that no points are declared
      as outliers.
      <p>
      On the other hand, swamping can occur when we specify too many
      outliers in the test.  For example, if we are testing for two or
      more outliers when there is in fact only a single outlier, both
      points may be declared outliers (many tests will declare either
      all or none of the tested points as outliers).
      <p>
      Due to the possibility of masking and swamping, it is useful to
      complement formal outlier tests with graphical methods.  Graphics
      can often help identify cases where masking or swamping may be an
      issue.  Swamping and masking are also the reason that many tests
      require that the exact number of outliers being tested must be
      specified.
      <p>
      Also, masking is one reason that trying to apply a single outlier
      test sequentially can fail.  For example, if there are multiple
      outliers, masking may cause the outlier test for the first outlier
      to return a conclusion of no outliers (and so the testing for any
      additional outliers is not performed).

   <td width=85% valign=top>
      The Z-score of an observation is defined as
      <ul>
          <!--
          <img src="eqns/zscore.gif" alt="Z(i) = (Y(i) - ybar)/s">

          \[ Z_i = \frac{Y_i - \bar{Y}} {s} \]
      </ul>
      with <!-- <img align=absmiddle src="eqns/ybar.gif" alt="ybar"> -->
      \(\bar{Y}\) and <b><i>s</i></b> denoting the sample mean and sample
      standard deviation, respectively.
      <!--  According to Andrew Rukhin, this really transforms to a
            t distribution, recommended we just comment out this
            sentence
      The Z-score has the effect of transforming data
      that follows an approximately normal distribution to data that 
      follows an approximately standard normal distribution (i.e., 
      mean = 0, standard deviation = 1).
      -->
      In other words, data is given in units of how many standard
      deviations it is from the mean.
      <p>
      Although it is common practice to use Z-scores to identify possible
      outliers, this can be misleading (partiucarly for small sample sizes)
      due to the fact that the maximum Z-score is at most
      <!--
      <img align=absmiddle src="eqns/maxzscor.gif" alt="(n-1)/SQRT(n)">.
      -->
      \((n-1)/\sqrt{n}\)
      <p>
      <a href="../section4/eda43.html#Iglewicz">Iglewicz and Hoaglin</a>
      recommend using the modified Z-score
      <p>
      <ul>
          <!--
          <img src="eqns/modzscor.gif" alt=
               "M(i) = 0.6745*(x(i) - xtilde)/MAD">
          -->
          \[ M_{i} = \frac{0.6745(x_{i} - \tilde{x})} {\mbox{MAD}} \]
      </ul>
      <p>
      with MAD denoting the <a href=

      median absolute deviation</a> and

      \(\tilde{x}\) denoting the median.
      <p>
      These authors recommend that modified Z-scores with an absolute
      value of greater than 3.5 be labeled as potential outliers.

      </A>
   </td>
   <td width=85% valign=top>
      A number of formal outlier tests have proposed in the
      literature.  These can be grouped by the following characteristics:
      <ul>
         <li>What is the distributional model for the data?  We restrict
             our discussion to tests that assume the data follow an
             approximately normal distribution.
             <p>
         <li>Is the test designed for a single outlier or is it designed
             for multiple outliers?
             <p>
         <li>If the test is designed for multiple outliers, does the
             number of outliers need to be specified exactly or can
             we specify an upper bound for the number of outliers?
      </ul>
      The following are a few of the more commonly used outlier tests
      for normally distributed data.  This list is not exhaustive
      (a large number of outlier tests have been proposed in the
      literature).  The tests given here are essentially based on the
      criterion of "distance from the mean".  This is not the only
      criterion that could be used.  For example, the Dixon test, which
      is not discussed here, is based a value being too large (or small)
      compared to its nearest neighbor.
      <ol>
         <li><a href="eda35h1.html">Grubbs' Test</a> - this is the
             recommended test when testing for a single outlier.
             <p>
         <li><a href="eda35h2.html">Tietjen-Moore Test</a> - this is
             a generalization of the Grubbs' test to the case of
             more than one outlier.  It has the limitation that the
             number of outliers must be specified exactly.
             <p>
         <li><a href="eda35h3.html">Generalized Extreme Studentized Deviate
             (ESD) Test</a> - this test requires only an upper bound on
             the suspected number of outliers and is the recommended
             test when the exact number of outliers is not known.

   <td width=85% valign=top>
      The tests discussed here are specifically based on the
      assumption that the data follow an approximately normal
      disribution.  If your data follow an approximately
      <a href="eda3669.html">lognormal distribution</a>, 
      you can transform the data to normality by taking the
      logarithms of the data and then applying the outlier
      tests discussed here.

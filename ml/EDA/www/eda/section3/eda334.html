   <td width=85% valign=top>
      To generate a bootstrap uncertainty estimate for a given
      statistic from a set of data, a subsample of a size less
      than or equal to the size of the data set is
      generated from the data, and the statistic is calculated.
      This subsample is generated <I>with replacement</I> so
      that any data point can be sampled multiple times or not
      sampled at all.  This process is repeated for many
      subsamples, typically between 500 and 1000.  The computed
      values for the statistic form an estimate of the sampling
      distribution of the statistic.
      <p>
      For example, to estimate the uncertainty of the median from
      a dataset with 50 elements, we generate a subsample of 50
      elements and calculate the median.  This is repeated at
      least 500 times so that we have at least 500 values for the
      median.  Although the number of bootstrap samples to use is
      somewhat arbitrary, 500 subsamples is usually sufficient.
      To calculate a 90% confidence interval for the median, the
      sample medians are sorted into ascending order and the value
      of the 25th median (assuming exactly 500 subsamples were taken)
      is the lower confidence limit while the value of the 475th
      median (assuming exactly 500 subsamples were taken) is the
      upper confidence limit.

      <p>
      This bootstrap plot was generated from 500 uniform random
      numbers.  Bootstrap plots and corresponding histograms
      were generated for the mean, median, and mid-range.  The
      histograms for the corresponding statistics clearly show that
      for uniform random numbers the mid-range has the smallest
      variance and is, therefore, a superior location estimator to
      the mean or the median.

         The bootstrap plot is formed by:
         <ul>
            <li>Vertical axis: Computed value of the desired statistic
                for a given subsample.
            <li>Horizontal axis: Subsample number.
         </ul>
         The bootstrap plot is simply the computed value of the
         statistic versus the subsample number.  That is, the
         bootstrap plot generates the values for the desired
         statistic.  This is usually immediately followed by a
         histogram or some other distributional plot to show the
         location and variation of the sampling
         distribution of the statistic.

      The bootstrap plot is used to answer the following questions:
      <ul>
         <li>What does the sampling distribution for the statistic
             look like? 
         <li>What is a 95% confidence interval for the statistic?
         <li>Which statistic has a sampling distribution with the
             smallest variance?  That is, which statistic generates
             the narrowest confidence interval?
      </ul>

      <I>Importance</I>

   <td width=85% valign=top>
      The most common uncertainty calculation is generating a
      confidence interval for the mean.  In this case, the 
      uncertainty formula can be derived mathematically.  However,
      there are many situations in which the uncertainty
      formulas are mathematically intractable.  The bootstrap
      provides a method for calculating the uncertainty in these
      cases.

<!-- Add main text below -->
The bootstrap is not appropriate for all distributions and
statistics (<a href-"../section4/eda43.htm#TIBRASHANI">Efron and
Tibrashani</a>).  For example, because of the shape of the uniform
distribution, the bootstrap is not appropriate for estimating the
distribution of statistics that are heavily dependent on the
tails, such as the range.

The bootstrap is becoming more common in general purpose statistical
software programs.  However, it is still not supported in many of
these programs.  Both R software and Dataplot
support a bootstrap capability.

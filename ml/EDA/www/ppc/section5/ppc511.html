In a semiconductor manufacturing process flow, we have a step whereby
we grow an oxide film on the silicon wafer using a furnace. In this
step, a cassette of wafers is placed in a quartz "boat" and the boats
are placed in the furnace. The furnace can hold four boats. A gas flow
is created in the furnace and it is brought up to temperature and held
there for a specified period of time (which corresponds to the desired
oxide thickness).  This study was conducted to determine if the process
was stable and to characterize sources of variation so that a process
control strategy could be developed.

The goal of this study is to determine if this process is capable of
consistently growing oxide films with a thickness of 560 Angstroms
+/- 100 Angstroms. An additional goal is to determine important sources
of variation for use in the development of a process control strategy.

In the picture below we are modeling this process with one output (film
thickness) that is influenced by four controlled factors (gas flow,
pressure, temperature and time) and two uncontrolled factors (run and
zone). The four controlled factors are part of our recipe and will
remain constant throughout this study. We know that there is run-to-run
variation that is due to many different factors (input material
variation, variation in consumables, etc.). We also know that the
different zones in the furnace have an effect. A zone is a region of
the furnace tube that holds one boat. There are four zones in these
tubes. The zones in the middle of the tube grow oxide a little bit
differently from the ones on the ends. In fact, there are temperature
offsets in the recipe to help minimize this problem.

<!-- Add main text below -->
The sensitivity model for this process is fairly straightforward and
is given in the figure below.  The effects of the machine
are mostly related to the preventative maintenance (PM) cycle.  We
want to make sure the quartz tube has been cleaned recently, the mass
flow controllers are in good shape and the temperature controller
has been calibrated recently. The same is true of the measurement
equipment where the thickness readings will be taken. We want to make
sure a <a href="../../mpc/section4/mpc4.html">gauge study</a> has been
performed.  For material, the incoming wafers will certainly have
an effect on the outgoing thickness as well as the quality of the
gases used. Finally, the recipe will have an effect including gas flow,
temperature offset for the different zones, and temperature profile
(how quickly we raise the temperature, how long we hold it and how
quickly we cool it off).

Sampling Plan

</A>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%>
<!-- Add main text below -->
Given our goal statement and process modeling, we can now define a
sampling plan.  The primary goal is to determine if the process is
capable.  This just means that we need to monitor the process over
some period of time and compare the estimates of process location and
spread to the specifications.  An additional goal is to identify
sources of variation to aid in setting up a process control strategy.
Some obvious sources of variation are incoming wafers, run-to-run
variability, variation due to operators or shift, and variation due
to zones within a furnace tube.  One additional constraint that we
must work under is that this study should not have a significant
impact on normal production operations.
<P>
Given these constraints, the following sampling plan was selected.  It
was decided to monitor the process for one day (three shifts).
Because this process is operator independent, we will not keep shift or
operator information but just record run number.  For each run, we will
randomly assign cassettes of wafers to a zone.  We will select two
wafers from each zone after processing and measure two sites on each
wafer.  This plan should give reasonable estimates of run-to-run
variation and within zone variability as well as good overall
estimates of process location and spread.
<p>
We are expecting readings around 560 Angstroms.  We would not expect
many readings above 700 or below 400.  The measurement equipment is
accurate to within 0.5 Angstroms which is well within the accuracy
needed for this study.

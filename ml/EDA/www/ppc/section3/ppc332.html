<i>A sampling scheme defines what data will be obtained and how</i>
</td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="85%">
A sampling scheme is a detailed description of what data will be
obtained and how this will be done.  In PPC we are faced with two
different situations for developing sampling schemes.  The first is
when we are conducting a controlled experiment.  There are very
efficient and exact methods for developing sampling schemes for
designed experiments and the reader is referred to the
<a href="../../index-3.html">Process Improvement</a> chapter for details.
</td>

<tr>
<td valign=top width="15%">
<i>Passive data collection</i>
</td>

<td valign=top width="85%">
The second situation is when we are conducting a passive data collection
(PDC) study to learn about the inherent properties of a process.
These types of studies are usually for comparison purposes when we
wish to compare properties of processes against each other or against
some hypothesis.  This is the situation that we will focus on here.
</td>

<tr NOSAVE>
<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="15%" NOSAVE>
<i>There are two principles that guide our
choice of sampling scheme</i>
</td>

<td VALIGN=TOP VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="85%" NOSAVE>
Once we have selected our response parameters, it would seem to be a
rather straightforward exercise to take some measurements, calculate
some statistics and draw conclusions.  There are, however, many
things which can go wrong along the way that can be avoided with
careful planning and knowing what to watch for.  There are two
overriding principles that will guide the design of our sampling
scheme.
</td>
</tr>

<tr NOSAVE>
<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="15%" NOSAVE>
<i>The first is precision</i>
</td>

<td valign=top width="85%">
The first principle is that of <i>precision</i>. If the sampling
scheme is properly laid out, the difference between our estimate of some
parameter of interest and its <i>true</i> value will be due only to random
variation. The size of this random variation is measured by a quantity
called <i>standard error</i>. The magnitude of the standard error is
known as precision.  The smaller the standard error, the more precise
are our estimates.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign=top width="15%">
<i>Precision of an estimate depends on several factors</i>
</td>

<td valign=top width="85%">
The precision of any estimate will depend on:
<ul>
   <li>the inherent variability of the process estimator</li>
   <li>the measurement error</li>
   <li>the number of independent replications (sample size)</li>
   <li>the efficiency of the sampling scheme.</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>

<tr NOSAVE>
<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="15%" NOSAVE>
<i>The second is systematic sampling error (or confounded effects)</i>
</td>

<td valign=top width="85%">
The second principle is the avoidance of systematic errors.
Systematic sampling error occurs when the levels of one explanatory
variable are the same as some other unaccounted for explanatory
variable.  This is also referred to as confounded effects.  Systematic
sampling error is best seen by example.

<blockquote>
<i><u>Example 1:</u> </i> We want to compare the effect of
two different coolants on the resulting surface finish from a turning operation.
It is decided to run one lot, change the coolant and then run another lot. 
With this sampling scheme, there is no way to distinguish the coolant effect
from the lot effect or from tool wear considerations. There is systematic
sampling error in this sampling scheme.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<i><u>Example 2:</u></i>  We wish to examine the effect
of two pre-clean procedures on the uniformity of an oxide growth
process. We clean one cassette of wafers with one method and another
cassette with the other method. We load one cassette in the front of
the furnace tube and
the other cassette in the middle. To complete the run, we fill the rest
of the tube with other lots. With this sampling scheme, there is no way
to distinguish between the effect of the different pre-clean methods and
the cassette effect or the tube location effect. Again, we have
systematic sampling errors.
</blockquote>

<tr NOSAVE>
<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="15%" NOSAVE>
<i>Stratification helps to overcome systematic error</i>
</td>

<td valign=top width="85%">
The way to combat systematic sampling errors (and at the same time
increase precision) is through stratification and randomization. Stratification
is the process of segmenting our population across levels of some factor
so as to minimize variability within those segments or <i>strata</i>. For
instance, if we want to try several different process recipes to see
which one is best, we may want to be sure to apply each of the recipes
to each of the three work shifts.  This will ensure that we eliminate
any systematic errors caused by a shift effect. This is where the
<a href="http://www.nist.gov/itl/">ANOVA designs</a> are particularly
useful.
</td>
</tr>

<tr NOSAVE>
<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="15%" NOSAVE>
<i>Randomization helps too</i>
</td>

<td valign=top width="85%">
Randomization is the process of randomly applying the various treatment
combinations. In the above example, we would not want to apply recipe 1,
2 and 3 in the same order for each of the three shifts but would instead
randomize the order of the three recipes in each shift. This will avoid
any systematic errors caused by the order of the recipes.</td>

<i>Factors and responses</i>
</td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="85%">
Besides just observing our processes for evidence
of stability and capability, we quite often want to know about the relationships
between the various <b>Factors</b> and <b>Responses</b>.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="15%">
<i>We look for correlations and causal relationships</i>
</td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="85%">
There are generally two types of relationships that we
are interested in for purposes of PPC.&nbsp; They are:&nbsp;
<dl>
<dt>
Correlation
</dt>

<dd>
Two variables are said to be correlated if an observed change in the level
of one variable is accompanied by a change in the level of another variable.&nbsp;
The change may be in the same direction (positive correlation) or in
the opposite direction (negative correlation).
</dd>

<dd>
</dd>

<dt>
Causality
</dt>

<dd>
There is a causal relationship between two variables if a change in the
level of one variable causes a change in the other variable.
</dd>
</dl>
Note that correlation does not imply causality.&nbsp; It is possible for
two variables to be associated with each other without one of them causing
the observed behavior in the other.&nbsp; When this is the case it is usually
because there is a third (possibly unknown) causal factor.&nbsp;</td>
</tr>

<tr NOSAVE>
<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="15%" NOSAVE>
<i>Our goal is to find causal relationships</i>
</td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="85%">
Generally, our ultimate goal in PPC is to find and quantify causal
relationships.  Once this is done, we can then take advantage of
these relationships to improve and control our processes.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="15%">
<i>Find correlations and then try to establish causal relationships</i>
</td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="85%">
Generally, we first need to find and explore correlations
and then try to establish causal relationships. It is much easier to find
correlations as these are just properties of the data. It is much more
difficult to prove causality as this additionally requires sound engineering
judgment.&nbsp; There is a systematic procedure we can use to accomplish
this in an efficient manner. We do this through the use of designed
experiments.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="15%">
<i>First we screen, then we build models</i>
</td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="85%">
When we have many potential factors and we want to see which ones
are correlated and have the potential to be involved in causal
relationships with the responses, we use <a href="../../index-3.html">screening
designs</a> to reduce the number of candidates.&nbsp; Once we have a reduced
set of influential factors, we can use <a href="../../index-3.html">response
surface designs</a> to model the causal relationships with the responses
across the operating range of the process factors.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign=top width="15%">
<i>Techniques discussed in process improvement chapter</i>
</td>

<td valign=top width="85%">
The techniques are covered in detail in the&nbsp; <a href="../../index-3.html">process
improvement</a> section and will not be discussed much in this chapter.
Examples of how the techniques are used in PPC are given in
the
<a href="../section5/ppc5.html">Case Studies</a>.

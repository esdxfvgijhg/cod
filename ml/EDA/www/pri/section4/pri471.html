<i>This example uses data from a NIST high performance ceramics
experiment</i>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85% VALIGN=TOP>
This data set was taken from an experiment that was performed a few
years ago at NIST by Said Jahanmir of the Ceramics Division in the
Material Science and Engineering Laboratory.  The original analysis
was performed primarily by Lisa Gill of the Statistical Engineering
Division.  The example shown here is an independent analysis of a
modified portion of the original data set.
<p>
The original data set was part of a high performance ceramics experiment
with the goal of characterizing the effect of grinding parameters on
sintered reaction-bonded silicon nitride, reaction bonded silicone
nitride, and sintered silicon nitride.
<p>
Only modified data from the first of the three ceramic types (sintered
reaction-bonded silicon nitride) will be discussed in this illustrative
example of a full factorial data analysis.

The reader can download the data as a

Purpose: To determine the effect of machining factors on ceramic strength
<br>Response variable = mean (over 15 repetitions) of the ceramic
    strength
<br>Number of observations = 32 (a complete 2<sup>5</sup> factorial
    design)
<ul>
   Response Variable Y = Mean (over 15 reps) of Ceramic Strength
   <br>
   Factor 1 = Table Speed (2 levels: slow (.025 m/s) and fast (.125 m/s))
   <br>
   Factor 2 = Down Feed Rate (2 levels: slow (.05 mm) and fast (.125 mm))
   <br>
   Factor 3 = Wheel Grit (2 levels: 140/170 and 80/100)
   <br>
   Factor 4 = Direction (2 levels: longitudinal and transverse)
   <br>
   Factor 5 = Batch (2 levels: 1 and 2)
</ul>
Since two factors were qualitative (direction and batch) and it was
reasonable to expect monotone effects from the quantitative factors,
no centerpoint runs were included.

Plot the response variable
</I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85% VALIGN=TOP>
We start by plotting the response data several ways to see if any trends
or anomalies appear that would not be accounted for by the standard
linear response models.
<p>
First, we look at the distribution of the response variable regardless
of factor levels by generating the following four plots.
<ol>
   <li>The first plot is a
       <a href="../../eda/section3/normprpl.html">normal probability
       plot</a> of the response variable. The red line is the theoretical 
       normal distribution.
   <li>The second plot is a <a href="../../eda/section3/boxplot.html">box
       plot</a> of the response variable. 
   <li>The third plot is a
       <a href="../../eda/section3/histogra.html">histogram</a> of the
       response variable.
   <li>The fourth plot is the response versus the run order.
</ol>
<P>
<center>
<img SRC="pri471_r01.gif" 
     ALT="4-plot: normal probability plot, box plot, histogram, run-order plot">
</center>
<p>
Clearly there is "structure" that we hope to account for when we fit
a response model. For example, the response variable is separated into
two roughly equal-sized clumps in the histogram.  The first clump is
centered approximately around the value 450 while the second clump
is centered approximately around the value 650.  As hoped for, the
run-order plot does not indicate a significant time effect.

Several factors, most notably "Direction" followed by "Batch" and

Theoretical model: assume all four-factor and higher interaction
terms are not significant
</I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85% VALIGN=TOP>
For a 2<sup>5</sup> full factorial experiment we can fit a model
containing a mean term, five main effect terms, ten two-factor
interaction terms, ten three-factor interaction terms, five
four-factor interaction terms, and a five-factor interaction term
(32 parameters).  However, we start by assuming all four-factor and
higher interaction terms are non-existent. It's very rare for such
high-order interactions to be significant, and they are very difficult
to interpret from an engineering viewpoint.  The assumption allows us to
accumulate the sums of squares for these terms and use them to estimate
an error term.  We start with a theoretical model with
26 unknown constants, hoping the data will clarify which of these are
the significant main effects and interactions we need for a final model.

Normal plot of the effects
</I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85% VALIGN=TOP>
Non-significant effects should effectively follow an approximately
normal distribution with the same location and scale.  Significant
effects will vary from this normal distribution.  Therefore, another
method of determining significant effects is to generate a normal 
probability plot of all 31 effects.  The effects that deviate
substantially from the straight line fit to the data are 
considered significant.  
Although this is a somewhat subjective criteria, it tends to work
well in practice.  It is helpful to use both the numerical output
from the fit and graphical techniques such as the normal probability
plot in deciding which terms to keep in the model.
<p>
A normal probability plot of the effects is shown below.  (To reduce 
the scale of the y-axis, the largest two effects, X4: Direction 
and X5: Batch, are not shown on the plot.  In addition, these two 
effects were not used to compute the normal reference line.)  The 
effects we consider to be significant are labeled.  In this case, we
have arrived at the exact same 12 terms by looking at the normal 
probability plot as we did from the stepwise regression.

<p>
Most of the effects cluster close to the center (zero) line and
follow the fitted normal model straight line. The effects that appear to
be above or below the line by more than a small amount are the same
effects identified using the stepwise routine, with the exception of
<i>X</i>1.  Some analysts prefer to include a main effect term
when it has several significant interactions even if the main
effect term itself does not appear to be significant.

At this stage, the model appears to account for most of the variability
in the response, achieving an adjusted R<sup>2</sup> of 0.982. All the
main effects are significant, as are six 2-factor interactions and
one 3-factor interaction. The only interaction that makes little
physical sense is the " <i>X</i>4: Direction*<i>X</i>5: Batch"
interaction - why would the response using one batch of material
react differently when the batch is cut in a different direction as
compared to another batch of the same formulation?
<p>
However, before accepting any model, residuals need to be examined.

The magnitudes of the effect estimates show that "Direction" is by far
the most important factor. "Batch" plays the next most critical role,
followed by "Wheel Grit". Then, there are several important interactions
followed by "Feed Rate". "Table Speed" plays a role in almost every
significant interaction term, but is the least important main effect
on its own.  Note that large interactions can obscure main effects.

The labels located in the diagonal spaces of the plot grid 
have two purposes.  First, the label indicates the factor 
associated with the x-axis for all plots in the same row.
Second, the label indicates the factor defining the two 
lines for plots in the same column.  
<P>
For example, the plot labeled r*s contains averages for 
low and high levels of the rate variable (x-axis) for 
both levels of speed.  The blue line represents the low 
level of speed and the pink line represents the high level 
of speed.  The two lines in the r*s plot cross, indicating 
that there is interaction between rate and speed.  Parallel 
lines indicate that there is no interaction between the two 
factors.

Based on the analyses, we can select factor settings that 
maximize ceramic strength.  Translating from "-1" and "+1" back to  
the actual factor settings, we have: Table speed at "1" or .125m/s; 
Down Feed Rate at "1" or .125 mm; Wheel Grit at "-1" or 140/170; 
and Direction at "-1" or longitudinal.
<p>
Unfortunately, "Batch" is also a very significant factor, with the first
batch giving higher strengths than the second. Unless it is possible to
learn what worked well with this batch, and how to repeat it, not much
can be done about this factor.

Analyses with value of Direction fixed indicates complex model is

</I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85% VALIGN=TOP>
<ol start=1>
   <li>One might ask what an analysis of just the 2<sup>4</sup> factorial
       with "Direction" kept at -1 (i.e., longitudinal) would yield. This
       analysis turns out to have a very simple model; only "Wheel Grit"
       and "Batch" are significant main effects and no interactions are
       significant.
       <p>
       If, on the other hand, we do an analysis of the 2<sup>4</sup>
       factorial with "Direction" kept at +1 (i.e., transverse), then we
       obtain a 7-parameter model with all the main effects and
       interactions we saw in the 2<sup>5</sup> analysis, except, of
       course, any terms involving "Direction".
       <p>
       So it appears that the complex model of the full analysis came
       from the physical properties of a transverse cut, and these
       complexities are not present for longitudinal cuts.

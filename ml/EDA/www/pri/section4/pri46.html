<i>Definition of confirmation runs</i>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85% VALIGN=TOP>
When the analysis of the experiment is complete, one must
verify that the predictions are good.  These are called confirmation
runs.
<p>
The interpretation and conclusions from an experiment may include a
"best" setting to use to meet the goals of the experiment.  Even if
this "best" setting were included in the design, you should run it
again as part of the confirmation runs to make sure nothing has changed
and that the response values are close to their predicted values.

<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top>
<i>At least 3 confirmation runs should be planned</i>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85% VALIGN=TOP>
In an industrial setting, it is very desirable to have a stable process.
Therefore, one should run more than one test at the "best" settings.  A
minimum of 3 runs should be conducted (allowing an estimate of
variability at that setting).
<p>
If the time between actually running the experiment and conducting the
confirmation runs is more than a few hours, the experimenter must be
careful to ensure that nothing else has changed since the original data
collection.

<i>Carefully duplicate the original environment</i>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85% VALIGN=TOP>
The confirmation runs should be conducted in an environment as similar
as possible to the original experiment. For example, if the experiment
were conducted in the afternoon and the equipment has a warm-up effect,
the confirmation runs should be conducted in the afternoon after the
equipment has warmed up.  Other extraneous factors that may change or
affect the results of the confirmation runs are: person/operator on the
equipment, temperature, humidity, machine parameters, raw materials, etc.

<i>Checks for when confirmation runs give surprises</i>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85% VALIGN=TOP>
What do you do if you don't obtain the results you expected?  If the
confirmation runs don't produce the results you expected:
<ol>
   <li>check to see that nothing has changed since the original
       data collection
   <li>verify that you have the correct settings for the confirmation
       runs
   <li>revisit the model to verify the "best" settings from the analysis
   <li>verify that you had the correct predicted value for the
       confirmation runs.
</ol>
If you don't find the answer after checking the above 4 items, the model
may not predict very well in the region you decided was "best".  You
still learned from the experiment and you should use the information
gained from this experiment to design another follow-up experiment.

Every well-designed experiment is a success in that you learn
something from it.  However, every experiment will not necessarily
meet the goals established before experimentation.  That is why it
makes sense to plan to

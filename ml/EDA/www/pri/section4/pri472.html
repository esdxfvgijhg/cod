<i>The experiment has five factors that might affect the distance the
golf ball travels</i>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85% VALIGN=TOP>
<i>Purpose</i>: To determine the significant factors that affect the
distance the ball is thrown by the catapult, and to determine the
settings required to reach three different distances (30, 60 and 90 inches).
<p>
<i>Response Variable</i>: The distance in inches from the front of the
catapult to the spot where the ball lands. The ball is a plastic golf
ball.
<p>
<i>Number of observations:</i> 20 (a 2<sup>5-1</sup> resolution
V design with 4 center points).

<i>Variables</i>:
<ol>
   <li>Response Variable <i>Y</i> = distance
       <p>
   <li>Factor 1 = band height (height of the pivot point for the rubber
       bands, levels were 2.25 and 4.75 inches with a centerpoint
       level of 3.5)
       <p>
   <li>Factor 2 = start angle (location of the arm when the operator
       releases, starts the forward motion of the arm, levels
       were 0 and 20 degrees with a centerpoint level of 10 degrees)
       <p>
   <li>Factor 3 = rubber bands (number of rubber bands used on the
       catapult, levels were 1 and 2 bands)
       <p>
   <li>Factor 4 = arm length (distance the arm is extended, levels
       were 0 and 4 inches with a centerpoint level of 2 inches)
       <p>
   <li>Factor 5 = stop angle (location of the arm where the forward
       motion of the arm is stopped and the ball starts flying,
       levels were 45 and 80 degrees with a centerpoint level of 62
       degrees)

The model has a good R<sup>2</sup> value, but the fact that R<sup>2</sup>
adjusted is considerably smaller indicates that we undoubtedly have some
terms in our model that are not significant. Scanning the column of

significant effects at the 0.05 level and another one at the 0.10 level.
<p>
A normal probability plot of effects is a useful graphical tool to determine
significant effects.  The graph below shows that there are nine terms
in the model that can be assumed to be noise. That would leave six terms
to be included in the model. Whereas the output above shows a
<i>p</i>-value of 0.0836 for the interaction of Bands (b) and Length (l), 
the normal plot suggests we treat this interaction as significant.

To examine the assumption that the residuals are approximately normally

four plots of the residuals:  a normal probability plot, box plot, 
histogram, and a run-order plot of the residuals.  In the run-order plot, 
the highlighted points are the centerpoint values.  Recall that run 
numbers 2 and 13 had two rubber bands while run numbers 7 and 19 had only

There does not appear to be a pattern to the residuals. One observation
about the graph, from a single point, is that the model performs poorly
in predicting a short distance.  In fact, run number 10 had a measured
distance of 8 inches, but the model predicts -11 inches, giving a
residual of 19 inches.  The fact that the model predicts an impossible
negative distance is an obvious shortcoming of the model. We may not be
successful at predicting the catapult settings required to hit a distance
less than 25 inches.  This is not surprising since there is only
one data value less than 28 inches.  Recall that the objective is to
achieve distances of 30, 60, and 90 inches.

Consider a transformation of the response variable to see if we can

</td>

<td ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="85%">
At this point, since there are several unsatisfactory features of the
model we have fit and the resultant residuals, we should consider whether
a simple transformation of the response variable (<i>Y</i> = "Distance")
might improve the situation.
<p>
There are at least two good reasons to suspect that using the logarithm
of distance as the response might lead to a better model.
<ol>
   <li>A linear model fit to ln(<i>Y</i>) will always predict a positive
       distance when converted back to the original scale for
       any possible combination of <i>X</i> factor values.</li>
   <li>Physical considerations suggest that a realistic model for
       distance might require quadratic terms since gravity plays a
       key role - taking logarithms often reduces the impact of
       non-linear terms.</li>
</ol>
To see whether using ln(<i>Y</i>) as the response leads to a more
satisfactory model, we return to step 3.

This is a simpler model than previously obtained in Step 3 (no
interaction term).  All the terms are highly significant and there
is no indication of a significant lack of fit.

We next look at the residuals for this new model fit.

These plots still appear to have a slight "frown" on the graph (higher
residuals in the center). However, the model is generally an improvement
over the previous model and will be accepted as possibly the best that
can be done without conducting a new experiment designed to fit a
quadratic model.

Based on the analyses and plots, we can select factor settings that 
maximize the log-transaformed distance.  Translating from "-1", "0", 
and "+1" back to the actual factor settings, we have: band height at 
"0" or 3.5 inches; start angle at "0" or 10 degrees; number of rubber 
bands at "1" or 2 bands; arm length at "1" or 4 inches , and stop 
angle at "0" or 80 degrees.

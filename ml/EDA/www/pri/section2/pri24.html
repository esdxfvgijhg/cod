Residuals are the differences between the observed and predicted
responses
</I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85% VALIGN=TOP>
Residuals are estimates of experimental error obtained by <i>subtracting
the observed responses from the predicted responses.</i>
<p>
The predicted response is calculated from the chosen model, after all
the unknown model parameters have been estimated from the experimental
data.
<p>
Examining residuals is a key part of all statistical modeling,
including DOE's.  Carefully looking at residuals can tell us whether
our assumptions are reasonable and our choice of model is
appropriate.

</I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85% VALIGN=TOP>
<a NAME="Residuals"></a>Residuals can be thought of as elements of
variation unexplained by the fitted model.  Since this is a form of
error, the same general assumptions apply to the group of residuals
that we typically use for errors in general: <i>one expects them to be
(roughly) normal and (approximately) independently distributed with a
mean of 0 and some constant variance</i>.

Assumptions for residuals
</I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85% VALIGN=TOP>
These are the assumptions behind ANOVA and classical regression
analysis.  This means that an analyst should expect a regression model
to err in predicting a response in a random fashion; the model should
predict values higher than actual and lower than actual with equal
probability.  In addition, the level of the error should be independent
of when the observation occurred in the study, or the size of the
observation being predicted, or even the factor settings involved in
making the prediction.  The overall pattern of the residuals should be
similar to the bell-shaped pattern observed when plotting a histogram
of normally distributed data.
<p>
We emphasize the use of <i>graphical methods</i> to examine residuals.

Identifying that structure and adding term(s) representing it to the

The histogram is a frequency plot obtained by placing the data in
regularly spaced cells and plotting each cell frequency versus
the center of the cell. Figure 2.2 illustrates an approximately normal
distribution of residuals produced by a model for a calibration

<TD WIDTH=85% VALIGN=TOP>
Sample sizes of residuals are generally small (&lt;50) because

not be the best choice for judging the distribution of residuals.  A
more sensitive graph is the normal probability plot.

The steps in forming a normal probability plot are:
<ul>
   <li>Sort the residuals into ascending order.
       <p>
   <li>Calculate the cumulative probability of each residual using
       the formula:
       <p>
       <ul>
          <i>P</i>(<i>i</i>-th residual) = <i>i</i>/(<i>N</i>+1)
       </ul>
       <p>
       with <i>P</i> denoting the cumulative probability of a point,
       <i>i</i> is the order of the value in the list and <i>N</i> is the
       number of entries in the list.
       <p>
   <li>Plot the calculated <i>p</i>-values versus the residual value on
       normal probability paper.
</ul>
The normal probability plot should produce an approximately straight
line if the points come from a normal distribution.

This graph includes the addition of a dot plot.  The dot plot is the

Small departures from the straight line in the normal probability plot
are common, but a clearly "S" shaped curve on this graph suggests a
bimodal distribution of residuals.  Breaks near the middle of this graph
are also indications of abnormalities in the residual distribution.

NOTE: Studentized residuals are residuals converted to a scale
approximately representing the standard deviation of an individual
residual from the center of the residual distribution.  The technique
used to convert residuals to this form produces a Student's t

The residuals in Figure 2.4 suggest a time trend, while those in Figure
2.5 do not.  Figure 2.4 suggests that the system was drifting slowly to
lower values as the investigation continued.  In extreme cases a drift
of the equipment will produce models with very poor ability to account
for the variability in the data (low R<sup>2</sup>).
<p>
If the investigation includes centerpoints, then plotting them in time
order may produce a more clear indication of a time trend if one exists.
Plotting the raw responses in time sequence can also sometimes detect
trend changes in a process that residual plots might not detect.

Check for increasing residuals as size of fitted value increases

</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85% VALIGN=TOP>
Plotting residuals versus the value of a fitted response should produce
a distribution of points scattered randomly about 0, regardless of the
size of the fitted value. Quite commonly, however, residual values may
increase as the size of the fitted value increases. When this happens,
the residual cloud becomes "funnel shaped" with the larger end toward
larger fitted values; that is, the residuals have larger and larger
scatter as the value of the response increases.  Plotting the absolute
values of the residuals instead of the signed values will produce a
"wedge-shaped" distribution; a smoothing function is added to each
graph which helps to show the trend.

A residual distribution such as that in Figure 2.6 showing a trend to
higher absolute residuals as the value of the response increases
suggests that one should transform the response, perhaps by modeling
its logarithm or square root, etc., (contractive transformations).
Transforming a response in this fashion often simplifies its
relationship with a predictor variable and leads to simpler models.
Later sections discuss transformation in more detail.  Figure 2.7 plots
the residuals after a transformation on the response variable was
used to reduce the scatter.  Notice the difference in scales on the
vertical axes.

Figure 2.8 shows that the size of the residuals changed as a function
of a predictor's settings.  A graph like this suggests that the model
needs a higher-order term in that predictor or that one should
transform the predictor using a logarithm or square root, for example.
Figure 2.9 shows the residuals for the same response after adding a
quadratic term.  Notice the single point widely separated from the other
residuals in Figure 2.9.  This point is an "outlier."  That is, its
position is well within the range of values used for this predictor in
the investigation, but its result was somewhat lower than the model
predicted.  A signal that curvature is present is a trace resembling a
"frown" or a "smile" in these graphs.

The example given in Figures 2.8 and 2.9 obviously involves five levels

For the simple factorial design that includes center points, if the
response model being considered lacked one or more higher-order terms,
the plot of residuals versus factor settings might appear as in
Figure 2.10.

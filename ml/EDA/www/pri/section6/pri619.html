In the <a href="pri618.html#conclusions">Important Factors and
Parsimonious Prediction</a> section, we selected the following model

    \( \hat{Y} = 2.65875 + 1.55125 X_{1} - 0.43375 X_{2} \)

The residual standard deviation for this model is 0.30429.
<P>
The next step is to 
<a href="../../pmd/section4/pmd44.html">validate the model</a>.
The primary method of model validation is graphical residual
analysis; that is, through an assortment of plots of the
differences between the observed data <i>Y</i> and the predicted value
\( \scriptsize \hat{Y} \)
<!-- <img src="splett3/eqns/yhat.gif" alt="yhat"> -->
from the model.  For example, the design point (-1, -1, -1) has an
observed data point (from <a href="pri611.html#datatable">the Background
and data</a> section) of <i>Y</i> = 1.70, while the predicted value from
the above fitted model for this design point is
<UL>
   \( \hat{Y} = 2.65875 + 1.55125 (-1) - 0.43375 (-1) \)

If the model fits well, \( \scriptsize \hat{Y} \)

Residual Standard Deviation

What is the magnitude of the typical residual? There are several
ways to compute this, but the statistically optimal measure is
the residual standard deviation:
<UL>
   \( s_{res} = \sqrt{ \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}{r_{i}^{2}}} {N-P}} \)
   <!--
   <img src="splett3/eqns/ressd.gif"
        alt="sres = sqrt(sum of squared residuals)/(n-p)">
   -->
</UL>
with <i>r<sub>i</sub></i> denoting the <i>i</i>th residual,
<i>N</i> = 8 is the number of observations, and
<i>P</i> = 3 is the number of fitted parameters.
From the <a href="pri616.html#predeq">table of prediction equations</a>,
the residual standard deviation is 0.30429.

How Should Residuals Behave?
</I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%>
<!-- Add main text below -->
If the prediction equation is adequate, the residuals from that equation
should behave like <a href="../../eda/section2/eda21.html">random
drawings</a> (typically from an approximately normal distribution), and
should, since presumably random, have no structural relationship with
any factor.  This includes any and all potential terms (<i>X</i>1,
<i>X</i>2, <i>X</i>3, 
<i>X</i>1*<i>X</i>2, 
<i>X</i>1*<i>X</i>3,
<i>X</i>2*<i>X</i>3, 
<i>X</i>1*<i>X</i>2*<i>X</i>3).
<P>
Further, if the model is adequate and complete, the
residuals should have no structural relationship with <b>any</b>
other variables that may have been recorded.  In particular, this
includes the run sequence (time), which is really serving as a
surrogate for any physical or environmental variable correlated
with time.  Ideally, all such residual scatter plots should appear
structureless.  Any scatter plot that exhibits structure suggests
that the factor should have been formally included as part of
the prediction equation.
<P>
Validating the prediction equation thus means that we do a final
check as to whether any other variables may have been inadvertently
left out of the prediction equation, including variables
drifting with time.
<p>
The graphical residual analysis thus consists of scatter plots
of the residuals versus all three factors and four interactions
(all such plots should be structureless), a scatter plot of the
residuals versus run sequence (which also should be structureless),
and a normal probability plot of the residuals (which should be
near linear).  We present such plots below.

We make the following conclusions based on the above plots.
<ol>
<li>Main Effects and Interactions: The <i>X</i>1 and <i>X</i>2 scatter
    plots are "flat" (as they must be since 
    <i>X</i>1 and <i>X</i>2
    were explicitly included in the model).  The <i>X</i>3 plot shows
    some structure as does the <i>X</i>1*<i>X</i>3, the
    <i>X</i>2*<i>X</i>3, and the 
    <i>X</i>1*<i>X</i>2*<i>X</i>3 plots.
    The <i>X</i>1*<i>X</i>2 plot shows little structure.  The net
    effect is that the relative ordering of these scatter plots is
    very much in agreement (again, as it must be) with the relative
    ordering of the "unimportant" factors. 
    From the <a href="pri615.html#yatestable">table of effects</a>
    and the <i>X</i>2*<i>X</i>3 residual plot, the
    third most influential term to be added to the model would
    be <i>X</i>2*<i>X</i>3.  In effect, these plots offer a
    higher-resolution confirmation of the ordering of effects.
    On the other hand, none of these other factors "passed" the
    criteria given in the previous section, and so these
    factors, suggestively influential as they might be, are
    still not influential enough to be added to the model.
    <p>
<li>Time Drift: The run sequence scatter plot is random.  Hence
    there does not appear to be a drift either from time, or from
    any factor (e.g., temperature, humidity, pressure, etc.)
    possibly correlated with time.
    <p>
<li>Normality: The normal probability plot of the eight residuals
    has some trend, which suggests that additional terms might be
    added.  On the other hand, the correlation coefficient of the
    8 ordered residuals and the eight theoretical normal N(0,1)
    order statistic medians (which define the two axes of the
    plot) has the value 0.934, which is
    well within acceptable (5 %) limits of the
    <a href="../../eda/section3/eda3676.html">normal probability
    plot correlation coefficient</a> test for normality.  Thus, the
    plot is not so non-linear as to reject normality.
</ol>
In summary, therefore, we accept the fitted model
<UL>
   \( \hat{Y} = 2.65875 + 1.55125 X_{1} - 0.43375 X_{2} \)
   <!--
   <img src="pri619_eq.gif"
        alt="Yhat = 2.65875 + 1.55125*X1 - 0.43375*X2">

</UL>
as a parsimonious, but good, representation of the
sensitivity phenomenon under study.

<i>Planning an experiment begins with carefully considering what
the objectives (or goals) are</i>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85% VALIGN=TOP>
The objectives for an experiment are best determined by a team
discussion. All of the objectives should be written down, even the
"unspoken" ones.
<p>
The group should discuss which objectives are the key ones, and which
ones are "nice but not really necessary". Prioritization of the
objectives helps you decide which direction to go with regard to the
selection of the factors, responses and the particular design. Sometimes
prioritization will force you to start over from scratch when you
realize that the experiment you decided to run does not meet one or
more critical objectives.

Examples of goals were given earlier in
<a href="../section1/pri12.html">Section 5.1.2</a>, in which we
described four broad categories of experimental designs, with various
objectives for each. These were:
<ul>
   <li><b>Comparative designs</b> to:</li>
       <ul>
          <li>choose between alternatives, with narrow scope, suitable
              for an initial comparison (see
              <a href="pri331.html">Section 5.3.3.1</a>)</li>
          <li>choose between alternatives, with broad scope, suitable
              for a confirmatory comparison (see Section
              <a href="pri332.html">5.3.3.2</a>)</li>
       </ul>
       <p>
   <li><b>Screening designs</b> to identify which factors/effects are
       important</li>
       <ul>
          <li>when you have 2 - 4 factors and can perform a full
              factorial (<a href="pri333.html">Section 5.3.3.3</a>)</li>
          <li>when you have more than 3 factors and want to begin with
              as small a design as possible (Section
              <a href="pri334.html">5.3.3.4</a> and
              <a href="pri335.html">5.3.3.5</a>)</li>
         <li>when you have some qualitative factors, or you have some
             quantitative factors that are known to have a non-monotonic
             effect (Section <a href="pri33a.html">3.3.3.10</a>)</li>
       </ul>
       <p>
       Note that some authors prefer to restrict the term screening
       design to the case where you are trying to extract the
       most important factors from a large (say > 5) list of initial
       factors (usually a fractional factorial design).  We include
       the case with a smaller number of factors, usually a full
       factorial design, since the basic purpose and analysis is
       similar.
       <p>
   <li><b>Response Surface</b> modeling to achieve one or more of the
       following objectives:</li>
       <ul>
          <li>hit a target</li>
          <li>maximize or minimize a response</li>
          <li>reduce variation by locating a region where the process
              is easier to manage</li>
          <li>make a process robust (note: this objective may often
              be accomplished with screening designs rather than with
              response surface designs - see
              <a href="../section5/pri56.html">Section 5.5.6</a>)</li>
       </ul>
       <p>
   <li><b>Regression modeling</b></li>
       <ul>
          <li>to estimate a precise model, quantifying the dependence
              of response variable(s) on process inputs.</li>
       </ul>

After identifying the objective listed above that corresponds most

       we discuss selecting experimental factors</li>
</ul>
and then
<ul>
   <li>select the appropriate design named in section

<br>The basic purpose of a fractional factorial design is to economically
investigate cause-and-effect relationships of significance in a given experimental
setting. This does not differ in essence from the purpose of any experimental
design. However, because we are now able to choose fractions of a full
design, and hence be more economical than ever, we also have to be aware
that different factorial designs serve different purposes. 
<p>Broadly speaking, designs of resolution three, and sometimes four, seek
to screen out the few important main effects from the many non-significant
others. For this reason these designs are often termed main effects designs,
or screening designs. 
<p>On the other hand, designs of resolution five, and higher, are used
for focusing on more than just main effects in an experimental situation.
These designs allow us to estimate interaction effects and investigate
whether there are quadratic effects. This gives us an idea of the (local)
shape of the response surface we are dealing with. For this reason they
are termed response-surface method (RSM) designs. 
<p>Within the screening/RSM strategy of design there are a number of functional
purposes that designs are put to. For example, an experiment might be designed
to determine how better to make a product or process robust against the
influence of external and non-controllable influences such as the weather.
Experiments might be designed to troubleshoot a process, to determine bottlenecks,
or to specify which component(s) of a product are most in need of improvement.
Experiments might also be designed to optimize yield, or to minimize defect
levels, or to move a process away from an unstable operating zone. All
these aims and purposes can be achieved using fractional factorial designs
and their appropriate design enhancements.

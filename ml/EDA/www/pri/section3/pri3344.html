We considered the 2<sup>3-1</sup> design in the previous section and

<TD WIDTH=85% VALIGN=TOP>
In order to construct the design, we do the following:
<ol>
   <li>Write down a
       <a href="pri3331.html#Standard Order for a 2k 2 Level Factorial">
       full factorial design in standard order</a> for <i>k</i>-<i>p</i>
       factors (8-3 = 5 factors for the example above). In the
       specification above we start with a 2<sup>5</sup> full factorial
       design.  Such a design has 2<sup>5</sup> = 32 rows.
       <p>
   <li>Add a sixth column to the design table for factor 6, using
       6 = 345 (or 6 = -345) to manufacture it (i.e., create the new
       column by multiplying the indicated old columns together).
       <p>
   <li>Do likewise for factor 7 and for factor 8, using the appropriate
       design generators given in Figure 3.6.
       <p>
   <li>The resultant design matrix gives the 32 trial runs for an
       8-factor fractional factorial design.  (When actually running
       the experiment, we would of course randomize the run order.

We note further that the design generators, written in `I = ...' form,
for the principal 2<sup>8-3</sup> fractional factorial design are:
<p>
<center>
{ I = + 3456; I = + 12457; I = +12358 }.

These design generators result from multiplying the "6 = 345"
generator by "6" to obtain "I = 3456" and so on for the other two
generators.

<i>"Defining relation" for a fractional factorial design</i>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85% VALIGN=TOP>
The total collection of design generators for a factorial design,
<i>including all new generators that can be formed as products of
these generators</i>, is called a <i>defining relation</i>.  There
are seven "<i>words",</i> or strings of numbers, in the defining
relation for the 2<sup>8-3</sup> design, starting with the original
three generators and adding all the new "words" that can be formed by
multiplying together any two or three of these original three words.
These seven turn out to be I = 3456 = 12457 = 12358 = 12367
= 12468 = 3478 = 5678.  In general, there will be

The length of the shortest word in the defining relation for the

\( 2_{IV}^{8-3} \).
Note that the <a href="pri3343.html#FIGURE">2<sup>3-1</sup> design</a> has
only one word, "I = 123" (or "I = -123"), in its defining relation since
there is only one design generator, and so this fractional factorial
design has resolution three; that is, we may write

<i>Resolution and confounding</i>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85% VALIGN=TOP>
The design resolution tells us how badly the design is confounded.
Previously, in the 2<sup>3-1</sup> design, we saw that the main effects
were confounded with two-factor interactions.  However, main effects
were not confounded with other main effects.  So, at worst, we have
3=12, or 2=13, etc., but we do not have 1=2, etc.  In fact, a
resolution II design would be pretty useless for any purpose whatsoever!
<p>
Similarly, in a resolution IV design, main effects are confounded with
at worst three-factor interactions. We can see, in Figure 3.7, that
6=345.  We also see that 36=45, 34=56, etc. (i.e., some two-factor
interactions are confounded with certain other two-factor interactions)
etc.; but we never see anything like 2=13, or 5=34, (i.e., main
effects confounded with two-factor interactions).

The complete confounding pattern, for confounding of up to two-factor

   <br>36 = 45

All of these relations can be easily verified by multiplying the
indicated two-factor interactions by the generators.  For example, to
verify that 38= 47, multiply both sides of 8=1235 by 3 to get 38=125. Then,
multiply 7=1245 by 4 to get 47=125. From that it follows that 38=47.

<i>One or two factors suspected of possibly having significant
first-order interactions can be assigned in such a way as to

</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85% VALIGN=TOP>
For this
<!--  <img align=absmiddle src="eqns/res5.gif" alt="2(V)**(8-3)"> -->
\( 2_{IV}^{8-3} \) fractional factorial design, 15 two-factor interactions
are aliased (confounded) in pairs or in a group of three.  The remaining
28 - 15 = 13 two-factor interactions are only aliased with higher-order
interactions (which are generally assumed to be negligible).
This is verified by noting that factors "1" and "2" never appear in
a length-4 word in the defining relation.  So, all 13 interactions
involving "1" and "2" are clear of aliasing with any other two factor
interaction.
<p>
If one or two factors are suspected of possibly having significant
first-order interactions, they can be assigned in such a way as to
avoid having them aliased.
<!--
<p>
If we are interested in estimating up to all the two factor interactions
of up to two factors, free of confounding with any other two-factor
interaction when running this design, we would assign those factors to
columns 1 or column 2 (i.e. name them <i>X</i><sub>1</sub> and
<i>X</i><sub>2</sub>). This type of consideration is often key in
choosing and setting up a design.

</td>

<td valign=top valign=top>
A resolution IV design is "better" than a resolution III design because
we have less-severe confounding pattern in the 'IV' than in the
'III' situation; higher-order interactions are less likely to be
significant than low-order interactions.
<p>
A higher-resolution design for the same number of factors will, however,
require more runs and so it is 'worse' than a lower order design in that
sense.

Resolution V designs for 8 factors

<TD WIDTH=85% VALIGN=TOP>
Similarly, with a resolution V design, main effects would be confounded
with four-factor (and possibly higher-order) interactions, and
two-factor interactions would be confounded with certain three-factor
interactions.  To obtain a resolution V design for 8 factors requires
more runs than the 2<sup>8-3</sup> design.  One option, if estimating
all main effects and two-factor interactions is a requirement, is a
<!-- <img align=absmiddle src="eqns/res5.gif" alt="2(V)**(8-3)"> -->
\( 2_{V}^{8-3} \) design.  However, a 48-run alternative

<b>Note</b>: There are other

different choices of design generators for the "6", "7" and "8" factor
columns. However, they are either equivalent (in terms of the number of
words of length of length of four) to the fraction with generators 6 = 345,
7 = 1245, 8 = 1235 (obtained by relabeling the factors), or they are
inferior to the fraction given because their defining relation contains
more words of length four (and therefore more confounded two-factor
interactions).  For example, the
<!-- <img align=absmiddle src="eqns/res5.gif" alt="2(V)**(8-3)"> -->
\( 2_{V}^{8-3} \) design with generators 6 = 12345, 7 = 135, and 8 = 245
has five length-four words in the defining relation (the defining relation
is I = 123456 = 1357 = 2458 = 2467 = 1368 = 123478 = 5678).  As a result,
this design would confound more two factor-interactions (23 out of 28
possible two-factor interactions are confounded, leaving only "12", "14",
"23", "27" and "34" as estimable two-factor interactions).

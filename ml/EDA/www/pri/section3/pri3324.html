<td WIDTH="85%">We have considered the 2<sup>3-1</sup> design in the previous
section, and seen that its generating relation written in '‘I =...'’form
is { I = + 123 }. Now consider the one-eighth fraction of a 2<sup>8 </sup>design,
namely the 2<sup>8-3</sup> fractional factorial design. Using a diagram
similar to <a href="pri3323.html#FIGURE">Figure 3.5</a>, we are given the
following: 
<br> 
<center>
<p><b>FIGURE 3.6  Specifications for a 2<sup>8-3</sup> Design</b>
<br><img SRC="gifs/arnonf10.gif" height=246 width=321></center>
Figure 3.6 tells us that a 2<sup>8-3 </sup>design has thirty-two runs,
not including centerpoint runs, and up to eight factors. There are three
generating relations. In order to construct the design, we do the following: 
<p>(1)  Write down a full factorial for 8-3 = 5 factors; that is,
a 2<sup>5</sup> full factorial design. Such a design has 2<sup>5</sup>
= 32 rows. 
<br>(2)  Add a sixth column to the design table for factor 6, using
6 = 345 (or 6 = -345) to manufacture it (i.e. using the column multiplication
we discussed above). 
<br>(3)  Do likewise for factor 7 and for factor 8, using the appropriate
generating relations given in Figure 3.6. 
<p>We note further that the generating relations, written in ‘I = ...’
form, for the 2<sup>8-3 </sup>is 
<center>{ I = ± 3456; I = ± 12457; I = ± 12358 }.</center>

<p>This collection of generating relations for a factorial design is called
a <i>defining relation</i>. There are three ‘<i>words</i>’ in the defining
relation for the 2<sup>8-3 </sup>design. The length of the shortest word
in the defining relation is called the <i>resolution</i> of the design.
<a href="../section1/pri12.html#Resolution">Resolution</a>
describes the degree to which estimated main effects are aliased (or confounded)
with estimated 2-level interactions, 3-level interactions, etc
<p>The length of the shortest word in the defining relation for the 2<sup>8-3</sup>
design is four. This is written in Roman numeral script, and sub-scripted
as 2<sub>IV</sub><sup>8-3</sup>. Note that the 2<sup>3-1</sup> design has
one word: ‘I = ±123’ in its defining relation, and so has resolution
three; that is, we may write 2<sub>III</sub><sup>3-1</sup>. 
<p>Now Figure 3.6 may be completed by writing it as: 
<center>
<p><b>FIGURE 3.7  Specifications for a 2<sup>8-3</sup>, Showing Resolution
‘IV’</b>
<br><img SRC="gifs/arnonf11.gif" height=244 width=332></center>
The design resolution tells us how badly the design is confounded. Previously,
in the 2<sup>3-1</sup> design, we saw the main effects were confounded
with two-factor interactions. However, main effects were not confounded
with other main effects. So, at worst, we have 3=12, or 2=13, etc., but
we do not have 1=1, or 2=2, etc. In fact, a resolution II design would
be pretty useless for any purpose whatsoever! 
<p>Similarly, in a resolution IV design, main effects are confounded with
at worst three-factor interactions. We can see, in Figure 3.7, that 6=345.
We also see that 36=45, 34=56, etc. (i.e. two-factor interactions are confounded
with certain other two-factor interactions) etc.; but we never see the
likes of  2=13, or 5=34, (main effects confounded with two-factor
interactions). 
<p>The complete confounding pattern, for confounding of up to two-factor
interactions, arising from the design given in Figure 3.7 is 
<center>
<p>34 = 56 = 78
<br>35 = 46
<br>36 = 45
<br>37 = 48
<br>38 = 47
<br>57 = 68</center>

<p>Note that we have deliberately left out reference to three-factor interactions,
and higher than three-factor interactions, because as we have said they
are assumed negligible. (This may be a wrong assumption in some rare instances). 
<p>If we are interested in estimating up to two of the two-factor interactions
free of confounding with other two-factor interaction when running this
design, we would assign those factors of interest to columns 1 or column
2. This type of consideration is often key in choosing and setting up a
design. 
<p>This means that a resolution IV design is ‘better’ than a resolution
III design because we have a less severe confounding pattern in the ‘IV’
than in the ‘III’ situation; higher order interactions are usually assumed
to be much less significant than low-order interactions. 
<p>A higher resolution design for the same number of factors will, however,
require more runs and so it is ‘worse’ than a lower-order design in that
sense. 
<p>Similarly, a resolution V design, main effects would be confounded with
at worst four-factor interactions, and two factor interactions would be
confounded with certain three-factor interactions. 
<p><b>Example</b>: The 2<sup>8-3</sup> design is of resolution IV, and
requires 32 runs. The 2<sup>8-2 </sup>design, also for eight factors, has
resolution V, but requires 64 runs. 
<p>The identifying relation for a design is not necessarily unique. An
alternative relation that will generate a 2<sup>8-3 </sup>design is { I
= ± 1236; I = ± 1247; I = ± 23458 }. Diagramatically,
this is

<p>The meaning of the most prevalent resolution levels is as follows:

<br>Main effects are confounded or aliased with two-factor

<br><b>Resolution IV Designs </b>
<br>No main effects are aliased  with two-factor interactions ,
<br>but two-factor interactions are aliased with each other. 
<p><b>Resolution V Designs</b>
<br>No main effect or two-factor interaction is aliased with any</center>
     other main effect or two-factor interaction, but
two-factor interactions are aliased with three-factor interactions</td>

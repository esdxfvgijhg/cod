<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="15%"><!-- Add marginal notes below --><i>Definitions
for key DOE terms</i></td>

<td WIDTH="85%">This page gives definitions and information for many of
the basic terms used in DOE.&nbsp;
<blockquote>
<li>
<a NAME="Alias:"></a><b><i>Alias</i></b>: When the estimate of an <a href="#Effect:">effect
</a>also
includes the influence of one or more other effects (usually high order
<a href="#Interactions:">interactions)</a>
the effects are said to be <i>aliased
</i>(see <a href="#Confounding"><i>confounding</i>)</a>.
For example, if the estimate of effect D in a four factor experiment actually
estimates (D + ABC), then the main effect D is aliased with the 3-way interaction
ABC. <b>Note</b>: This causes no difficulty when the higher order interaction
is either non-existent or insignificant.</li>

<li>
<a NAME="Analysis of Variance"></a><b><i>Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)</i></b>:
A mathematical process for separating the variability of a group of observations
into assignable causes and setting up various significance tests.</li>

<li>
<a NAME="Balanced"></a><b><i>Balanced Design</i></b>: An experimental design
where all cells (i.e. treatment combinations) have the same number of observations.</li>

<li>
<a NAME="Blocking"></a><b><i>Blocking</i></b>: A schedule for conducting
<a href="#Treatment">treatment
combinations</a> in an experimental study such that any effects on the
experimental results due to a known change in raw materials, operators,
machines, etc., become concentrated in the levels of the blocking variable.
<b>Note</b>:
the reason for blocking is to isolate a systematic effect and prevent it
from obscuring the main effects. Blocking is achieved by restricting <a href="#Randomization">randomization</a>.</li>

<li>
<a NAME="Center"></a><b><i>Center Points</i></b>: Points at the center
value of all factor ranges.</li>

<br><a NAME="Coding Factor"></a><b><i>Coding Factor Levels</i>: </b>Transforming
the scale of measurement for a factor so that the high value becomes +1
and the low value becomes -1 (see <i>scaling</i>). After coding all factors
in a 2-level full factorial experiment, the design matrix has all <a href="#Orthogonality">orthogonal</a>
columns.&nbsp;
<p>Coding&nbsp; is a simple linear transformation of the original measurement
scale. If the "high" value is X<sub>h</sub> and the "low" value is X<sub>L
</sub>(in
the original scale), then the scaling transformation takes any original
X value and converts it to (X - a)/b, where
<br>a = (X<sub>h</sub> + X<sub>L</sub>)/2 and b = ( X<sub>h</sub> -X <sub>L</sub>)/2.
<br>To go back to the original measurement scale, just take the coded value
and multiply it by "b" and add "a" or, X = b(coded value) + a.
<p>As an example, if the factor is temperature and the high setting is
65<sup>o</sup>C and the low setting is 55<sup>o</sup>C, then a = (65 +
55)/2 = 60 and b = (65 - 55)/2 = 5. The center point (where the coded value
is 0) has a temperature of 5(0) + 60 =&nbsp; 60<sup>o</sup>C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<li>
<a NAME="Comparative"></a><b><i>Comparative Designs</i></b>: A design aimed
at making conclusions about one a priori important factor, possibly in
the presence of one or more other "nuisance" factors.</li>

<li>
<a NAME="Confounding"></a><b><i>Confounding</i></b>:&nbsp; A confounding
design is one where some <a href="#Treatment">treatment effects</a> (main
or interactions) are estimated by the same linear combination of the experimental
observations as some <a href="#Blocking">blocking effects</a>. In this
case, the treatment effect and the blocking effect are said to be <i>confounded</i>.
Confounding is also used as a general term to indicate that the value of
a <a href="#main">main effect </a>estimate comes from both the main effect
itself and also contamination or bias from higher order <a href="#Interactions:">interactions.
Note</a>: Confounding designs naturally arise when <a href="../section3/pri331.html">full
factorial designs</a> have to be run in blocks and the block size is smaller
than the number of different treatment combinations. They also occur whenever
a <a href="../section3/pri332.html">fractional factorial design</a> is chosen
instead of a full factorial design.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
<a NAME="Crossed"></a><b><i>Crossed Factors:</i></b> See <i><a href="#Factors:">factors
below</a></i>.</li>

<li>
<a NAME="Design:"></a><b><i>Design</i></b>: A set of experimental runs
which allows you to fit a particular model and estimate your desired effects.</li>

<li>
<b><i>Design Matrix</i></b>: A <a href="../section3/pri32.html#The Design">matrix
description</a> of an experiment that is useful for constructing and analyzing
experiments.</li>

<li>
<a NAME="Effect:"></a><i><b>Effect</b>:</i> How changing the settings of
a factor changes the response. The effect of a single factor is also called
a&nbsp;<a NAME="main"></a><i>main effect</i>. <b>Note:</b> For a factor
A with two levels, <a href="#Scaling Factor">scaled </a>so that low = -1
and high = +1, the effect of A is estimated by subtracting the average
response when A is -1 from the average response when A = +1 and dividing
the result by 2 (division by 2 is needed because the -1 level is 2 scaled
units away from the +1 level).</li>

<li>
<a NAME="Error:"></a><b><i>Error</i></b>: Unexplained variation in a collection
of observations. <b>Note</b>: DOE's typically require understanding of
both random error and lack of fit error.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
<a NAME="Experimental"></a><b><i>Experimental Unit</i></b>: The entity
to which a specific treatment combination is applied. <b>Note</b>: an experimental
unit can be a</li>

<ul>
<li>
PC board</li>

<li>
silicon wafer</li>

<li>
tray of components simultaneously treated</li>

<li>
individual agricultural plants</li>

<li>
plot of land</li>

<li>
automotive transmissions</li>

<li>
etc.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<a NAME="Factors:"></a><i><b>Factors</b>: Process</i> <i>inputs</i> an
investigator manipulates to cause a change in the output. Some factors
cannot be controlled by the experimenter but may effect the responses.
If their effect is significant, these <i>uncontrolled factors</i> should
be measured and used in the data analysis. <b>Note</b>: The inputs can
be discrete or continuous.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<a NAME="Crossed"></a><b><i>Crossed Factors</i></b>: Two factors are <i>crossed
</i>if
every level of one occurs with every level of the other in the experiment.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
<a NAME="Nested"></a><b><i>Nested Factors</i></b>: A factor "A" is nested
within another factor "B" if the levels or values of "A" are different
for every level or value of "B". <b>Note</b>: Nested factors or effects
have a hierarchical relationship.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<a NAME="Fixed"></a><b><i>Fixed Effect</i></b>: An effect associated with
an input variable that has a limited number of levels or in which only
a limited number of levels are of interest to the experimenter.</li>

<li>
<a NAME="Interactions:"></a><b><i>Interactions</i></b>:<i> </i>Occurs when
the effect of one factor on a response depends on the level of another
factor(s).&nbsp;</li>

<li>
<a NAME="Lack of Fit"></a><b><i>Lack of Fit Error</i></b>:<i> </i>Error
that occurs when the analysis omits one or more important terms or factors
from the process model. <b>Note</b>: Including replication in a DOE allows
separation of experimental error into its components: lack of fit and random
(pure) error.</li>

<li>
<a NAME="Model:"></a><b><i>Model</i></b>:<i> </i>Mathematical relationship
which relates changes in a given response to changes in one or more factors.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
<a NAME="Nested"></a><b><i>Nested Factors</i></b>: See <i><a href="#Factors:">factors</a></i>
above.</li>

<li>
<a NAME="Orthogonality"></a><b><i>Orthogonality</i></b>: Two vectors of
the same length are orthogonal if the sum of the products of their corresponding
elements is 0. <b>Note</b>: An experimental design is orthogonal if the
effects of any factor balance out (sum to zero) across the effects of the
other factors.</li>

<li>
<a NAME="Random"></a><b><i>Random Effect</i></b>: An effect associated
with input variables chosen at random from a population having a large
or infinite number of possible values.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
<a NAME="Random"></a><b><i>Random error</i></b>:<i> </i>Error that occurs
due to natural variation in the process. Note: Random error is typically
<a href="../section2/pri24.html">assumed
</a>to
be normally distributed with zero mean and a constant variance. <b>Note</b>:
Random error is also called experimental error.</li>

<li>
<a NAME="Randomization"></a><b><i>Randomization</i></b>:<i> </i>A schedule
for allocating treatment material and for conducting treatment combinations
in a DOE such that the conditions in one run neither depend on the conditions
of the previous run nor predict the conditions in the subsequent runs.
<b>Note</b>:
The importance of randomization cannot be over stressed. Randomization
is necessary for conclusions drawn from the experiment to be correct, unambiguous
and defensible.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
<a NAME="Replication"></a><b><i>Replication</i></b>:<i> </i>Performing
the same treatment combination more than once. <b>Note</b>: Including replication
allows an estimate of the random error independent of any lack of fit error.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
<a NAME="Resolution"></a><b><i>Resolution</i></b>: A term which describes
the degree to which estimated main effects are <a href="#Alias:">aliased
</a>(or
<a href="#Confounding">confounded</a>)
with estimated 2-level <a href="#Interactions:">interactions</a>, 3-level
interactions, etc. In general, the resolution of a design is one more than
the smallest order interaction that some main effect is confounded (aliased)
with. If some main effects are confounded with some 2-level interactions,
the resolution is 3. <b>Note</b>:<a href="../section3/pri331.html"> Full
factorial</a> designs have no confounding and are said to have resolution
"infinity". For most practical purposes, a resolution 5 design is excellent
and a resolution 4 design may be adequate. Resolution 3 designs are useful
as economical <a href="#Screening">screening designs</a>.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
<a NAME="Responses"></a><b><i>Responses</i></b>:<i> </i>The output(s) of
a process. Sometimes called dependent variable(s).</li>

<li>
<a NAME="Response Surface"></a><b><i>Response Surface Designs</i></b>:
A DOE that fully explores the process window and models the responses.
<b>Note</b>:
These designs are most effective when there are less than 5 factors. Quadratic
models are used for response surface designs and at least three levels
of every factor are needed in the design.</li>

<li>
<a NAME="Rotatability"></a><b><i>Rotatability</i></b>: A design is <i>rotatable</i>
if the variance of the predicted response at any point <b>x </b>depends
only on the distance of <b>x</b> from the design <a href="#Center">center
point.</a> A design with this property can be rotated around its center
point without changing the prediction variance at <b>x</b>. <b>Note</b>:
Rotatability is a desirable property for response surface designs (i.e.
quadratic model designs).</li>

<li>
<a NAME="Scaling Factor"></a><b><i>Scaling Factor Levels</i></b>: <a href="../section3/pri32.html#Definition of">Transforming</a>
factor levels so that the high value becomes +1 and the low value becomes
-1.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
<a NAME="Screening"></a><b><i>Screening Designs</i></b>:<i> </i>A DOE that
identifies which of many factors have a significant effect on the response.
<b>Note</b>:
Typically screening designs have more than 5 factors.</li>

<li>
<a NAME="Treatment"></a><b><i>Treatment</i></b>: A treatment is a specific
combination of factor levels whose effect is to be compared with other
treatments.</li>

<li>
<a NAME="Treatment"></a><b><i>Treatment Combination</i></b>:<i> </i>The
combination of the settings of several factors in a given experimental
trial. Also known as a <i>run</i>.</li>

<li>
<a NAME="Variance"></a><b><i>Variance Components</i></b>:<i> </i>Partitioning
of the overall variation into assignable components.</li>

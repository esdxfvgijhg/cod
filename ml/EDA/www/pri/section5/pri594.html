The interaction effects matrix plot is an extension of the
<a href="pri593.html">DOE mean plot</a> to include both main effects
and 2-factor interactions (the DOE mean plot focuses on main effects
only).  The interaction effects matrix plot answers the following two
questions:
<ol>
   <li>What is the ranked list of factors (including 2-factor
       interactions), ranked from most important to least important;
       and
   <li>What is the best setting for each of the <i>k</i> factors?
</ol>
For a <i>k</i>-factor experiment, the effect on the response
could be due to main effects and various interactions all the way up
to <i>k</i>-term interactions.  As the number of factors, <i>k</i>,
increases, the total number of interactions increases
exponentially.  The total number of possible interactions of all
orders = 2<sup><i>k</i></sup> - 1 - <i>k</i>.  Thus for <i>k</i> = 3,
the total number of possible interactions = 4, but for <i>k</i> = 7
the total number of possible interactions = 120.
<p>
In practice, the most important interactions are likely to be 2-factor
interactions.  The total number of possible 2-factor interactions is
<!--
<ul>
   <img src="eqns/kchoose2.gif"
        alt="k-choose-2 = k!/[2!*(k-2)!]">
</ul>
-->
\[ \left( \begin{array}{c}
           k \\ 2
           \end{array}
   \right)
   = \frac{k!} {2!(k-2)!} = \frac{k(k-1)}{2}
\]
Thus for <i>k</i> = 3, the number of 2-factor interactions = 3, while
for <i>k</i> = 7, the number of 2-factor interactions = 21.
<p>
It is important to distinguish between the number of interactions
that are active in a given experiment versus the number of
interactions that the analyst is capable of making definitive
conclusions about.  The former depends only on the physics and
engineering of the problem.  The latter depends on the number of
factors, <i>k</i>, the choice of the <i>k</i> factors, the constraints
on the number of runs, <i>n</i>, and ultimately on the experimental
design that the analyst chooses to use.  In short, the number of
possible interactions is <b>not</b> necessarily identical to the
number of interactions that we can detect.
<p>
Note that
<ol>
   <li>with full factorial designs, we can uniquely
       estimate interactions of all orders;
   <li>with fractional factorial designs, we can uniquely estimate
       only some (or at times no) interactions; the more fractionated
       the design, the fewer interactions that we can estimate.

The interaction effects matrix plot is an upper right-triangular
matrix of <a href="../../eda/section3/meanplot.html"> mean plots</a>
consisting of <i>k</i> main effects plots on the diagonal and
<i>k</i>*(<i>k</i>-1)/2 2-factor interaction effects plots
on the off-diagonal.
<p>
In general, interactions are <b>not</b> the same as the usual
(multiplicative) cross-products.  However, for the special case of
2-level designs coded as (-, +) = (-1, +1), the interactions
<b>are</b> identical to cross-products.  By way of contrast,
if the 2-level designs are coded otherwise (e.g., the (1, 2) notation
espoused by Taguchi and others), then this equivalance is <b>not</b>
true.  Mathematically,
<ul>
   {-1, +1} x {-1, +1} => {-1, +1}
</ul>
but
<ul>
   {1, 2} x {1, 2} => {1, 2, 4}
</ul>
Thus, coding does make a difference.  We recommend the use of
the (-, +) coding.
<p>
It is remarkable that with the - and + coding, the 2-factor
interactions are dealt with, interpreted, and compared in the same
way that the <i>k</i> main effects are handled.  It is thus natural to
include both 2-factor interactions and main effects within the same
matrix plot for ease of comparison.
<p>
For the off-diagonal terms, the first construction step is to form
the horizontal axis values, which will be the derived values (also
- and +) of the cross-product.  For example, the settings for the
<i>X</i><sub>1</sub>*<i>X</i><sub>2</sub> interaction are derived by simple multiplication
from the data as shown below.
<ul>
<table noborder>
   <tr>
     <td valign=top align=center width=75>
        <i>X</i><sub>1</sub>
     </td>
     <td valign=top align=center width=75>
        <i>X</i><sub>2</sub>
     </td>
     <td valign=top align=center width=75>
        <i>X</i><sub>1</sub>*<i>X</i><sub>2</sub>
     </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td valign=top align=center>
        -
     </td>
     <td valign=top align=center>
        -
     </td>
     <td valign=top align=center>
        +
     </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td valign=top align=center>
        +
     </td>
     <td valign=top align=center>
        -
     </td>
     <td valign=top align=center>
        -
     </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td valign=top align=center>
        -
     </td>
     <td valign=top align=center>
        +
     </td>
     <td valign=top align=center>
        -
     </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td valign=top align=center>
        +
     </td>
     <td valign=top align=center>
        +
     </td>
     <td valign=top align=center>
        +
     </td>
   </tr>
</table>
</ul>
Thus <i>X</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>X</i><sub>2</sub>, and <i>X</i><sub>1</sub>*<i>X</i><sub>2</sub> all form a closed
(-, +) system.  The advantage of the closed system is that graphically
interactions can be interpreted in the exact same fashion as the
<i>k</i> main effects.
<p>
After the entire <i>X</i><sub>1</sub>*<i>X</i><sub>2</sub> vector of settings has been
formed in this way, the vertical axis of the <i>X</i><sub>1</sub>*<i>X</i><sub>2</sub>
interaction plot is formed:
<ol>
   <li>the plot point above <i>X</i><sub>1</sub>*<i>X</i></sub>2</sub> = "-" is simply the
       mean of all response values for which <i>X</i><sub>1</sub>*<i>X</i><sub>2</sub> = "-"
   <li>the plot point above <i>X</i><sub>1</sub>*<i>X</i><sub>2</sub> = "+" is simply the
       mean of all response values for which <i>X</i><sub>1</sub>*<i>X</i><sub>2</sub> = "+".
</ol>
We form the plots for the remaining 2-factor interactions in a
similar fashion.
<p>
All the mean plots, for both main effects and 2-factor interactions,
have a common scale to facilitate comparisons.  Each mean plot has
<ol>
   <li>Vertical Axis: The mean response for a given setting (- or +)
       of a given factor or a given 2-factor interaction.
       <p>
   <li>Horizontal Axis: The 2 settings (- and +) within each factor,
       or within each 2-factor interaction.
       <p>
   <li>Legend:
       <p>
       <ol>
          <li>A tag (1, 2, ..., <i>k</i>, 12, 13, etc.), with
              1 = <i>X</i><sub>1</sub>, 2 = <i>X</i><sub>2</sub>, ..., <i>k</i> =
              <i>X<sub>k</sub></i>, 12 = <i>X</i><sub>1</sub>*<i>X</i><sub>2</sub>,
              13 = <i>X</i><sub>1</sub>*<i>X</i><sub>3</sub>, 35 = <i>X</i><sub>3</sub>*<i>X</i><sub>5</sub>,
              123 = <i>X</i><sub>1</sub>*<i>X</i><sub>2</sub>*<i>X</i><sub>3</sub>, etc.) which
              identifies the particular mean plot; and
              <p>
          <li>The least squares estimate of the factor (or 2-factor
              interaction) effect.  These effect estimates are large
              in magnitude for important factors and near-zero in
              magnitude for unimportant factors.
       </ol>
</ol>
<a name="2levelmodel">
In a <a href="pri5995.html">later section</a>, we discuss in detail
the models associated with full and fractional factorial 2-level designs.
One such model representation is
<ul>
<!--
<font size = "5"><pre><i>Y</i> = <i>&mu;</i> + <i>&beta;</i><sub>1</sub>*<i>X</i><sub>1</sub> + <i>&beta;</i><sub>2</sub>*<i>X</i><sub>2</sub> + <i>&beta;</i><sub>12</sub>*<i>X</i><sub>1</sub>*<i>X</i><sub>2</sub> + ... + <i>&epsilon;</i>
</pre><font size = "3">
-->
\( Y = \mu + \beta_{1} X_{1} + \beta_{2} X_{2} + \beta_{12} X_{1} X_{2} +
       \cdots + \epsilon \)
</ul>
For factor variables coded with + and - settings, the
<i>&beta;</i><sub>i</sub> coefficient is one half of the effect estimate
due to factor <i>X</i><sub>i</sub>.  Thus, if we multiply the least-squares
coefficients by two, due to orthogonality, we obtain the simple difference
of means at the + setting and the - setting.  This is true for the
<i>k</i> main factors.  It is also true for all two-factor and
multi-factor interactions.
</a>
<p>
Thus, visually, the difference in the mean values on the plot is
identically the least squares estimate for the effect.  Large
differences (steep lines) imply important factors while small
differences (flat lines) imply unimportant factors.
<p>
<!-- In earlier sections, a somewhat different form of the model is
used (without the leading 0.5).  In this case, the plotted effects
are not necessarily equivalent to the least squares estimates.
When using a given software program, you need to be aware what
convention for the model the software uses.  In either case, the
effects matrix plot is still useful.  However, the estimates of the
coefficients in the model are equal to the effect estimates only if
the above convention for the model is used. -->

<!-- Add main text below -->
As discussed in detail above, the next logical step beyond main effects
is displaying 2-factor interactions, and this plot matrix provides a
convenient graphical tool for examining the relative importance of
main effects and 2-factor interactions in concert.  To do so, we make
use of the striking aspect that in the context of 2-level designs,
the 2-factor interactions are identical to cross-products and the
2-factor interaction effects can be interpreted and compared the same
way as main effects.

How to interpret
</I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%>
<!-- Add main text below -->
From the interaction effects matrix, we can draw three
important conclusions:
<ol>
   <li>Important Factors (including 2-factor interactions);
   <li>Best Settings;
   <li>Confounding Structure (for fractional factorial designs).
</ol>
We discuss each of these in turn.
<ol>
   <li><b>Important factors (including 2-factor interactions):</b>
       <p>
       Jointly compare the <i>k</i> main factors and the
       <i>k</i>*(<i>k</i>-1)/2
       2-factor interactions.  For each of these subplots, as we go
       from the "-" setting to the "+" setting within a subplot, is
       there a shift in location of the average data (yes/no)?
       Since all subplots have a common (-1, +1) horizontal axis,
       questions involving shifts in location translate into
       questions involving steepness of the mean lines (large
       shifts imply steep mean lines while no shifts
       imply flat mean lines).
       <p>
       <ol>
          <li>Identify the factor or 2-factor interaction that has the
              largest shift (based on averages).  This defines
              the "most important factor".  The largest shift is
              determined by the steepest line.
              <p>
          <li>Identify the factor or 2-factor interaction that has the
              next largest shift (based on averages).  This
              defines the "second most important factor".  This shift
              is determined by the next steepest line.
              <p>
          <li>Continue for the remaining factors.
       </ol>
       <p>
       This ranking of factors and 2-factor interactions
       based on local means is a major step in
       building the definitive list of ranked factors
       as required for screening experiments.
       <p>
   <li><b>Best settings:</b>
       <p>
       For each factor (of the <i>k</i> main factors along
       the diagonal), which setting (- or +) yields
       the "best" (highest/lowest) average response?
       <p>
       Note that the experimenter has the ability to change settings
       for only the <i>k</i> main factors, not for any 2-factor
       interactions.  Although a setting of some 2-factor interaction
       may yield a better average response than the alternative
       setting for that same 2-factor interaction, the experimenter is
       unable to set a 2-factor interaction setting in practice.
       That is to say, there is no "knob" on the machine that
       controls 2-factor interactions; the "knobs" only control the
       settings of the <i>k</i> main factors.
       <p>
       How then does this matrix of subplots serve as
       an improvement over the <i>k</i> best settings that
       one would obtain from the <a href="pri593.html">DOE mean
       plot</a>?  There are two common possibilities:
       <p>
       <ol>
          <li>Steep Line:
              <p>
              For those main factors along the diagonal that have
              steep lines (that is, are important), choose the best
              setting directly from the subplot.  This will be the same
              as the best setting derived from the DOE mean plot.
              <p>
          <li>Flat line:
              <p>
              For those main factors along the diagonal that have flat
              lines (that is, are unimportant), the naive conclusion to
              use either setting, perhaps giving preference to the
              cheaper setting or the easier-to-implement setting, may
              be unwittingly incorrect.  In such a case, the use of the
              off-diagonal 2-factor interaction information from the
              interaction effects matrix is critical for deducing the
              better setting for this nominally "unimportant" factor.
              <p>
              To illustrate this, consider the following example:
              <p>
              <ul>
                 <li>Suppose the factor <i>X</i><sub>1</sub> subplot is steep
                     (important) with the best setting for <i>X</i><sub>1</sub>
                     at "+".
                 <li>Suppose the factor <i>X</i><sub>2</sub> subplot is flat
                    (unimportant) with both settings yielding about
                    the same mean response.
              </ul>
              <p>
              Then what setting should be used for <i>X</i><sub>2</sub>? To answer
              this, consider the following two cases:
              <p>
              <ol>
                 <li>Case 1. If the <i>X</i><sub>1</sub>*<i>X</i><sub>2</sub> interaction plot
                     happens also to be flat (unimportant), then choose
                     either setting for <i>X</i><sub>2</sub> based on cost or ease.
                 <li>Case 2. On the other hand, if the
                     <i>X</i><sub>1</sub>*<i>X</i><sub>2</sub> interaction plot is steep
                     (important), then this dictates a prefered setting
                     for <i>X</i><sub>2</sub> <b>not</b> based on cost or ease.
              </ol>
              <p>
              To be specific for case 2, if <i>X</i><sub>1</sub>*<i>X</i><sub>2</sub> is
              important, with <i>X</i><sub>1</sub>*<i>X</i><sub>2</sub> = "+" being the
              better setting, and if <i>X</i><sub>1</sub> is important, with
              <i>X</i><sub>1</sub> = "+" being the better setting, then
              this implies that the best setting for <i>X</i><sub>2</sub> must be
              "+" (to assure that <i>X</i><sub>1</sub>*<i>X</i></sub>2</sub> (= +*+) will also
              be "+").  The reason for this is that since we are already
              locked into <i>X</i><sub>1</sub> = "+", and since <i>X</i><sub>1</sub>*<i>X</i><sub>2</sub>
              = "+" is better, then the only way we can obtain
              <i>X</i><sub>1</sub>*<i>X</i><sub>2</sub> = "+" with <i>X</i><sub>1</sub> = "+" is for
              <i>X</i><sub>2</sub> to be "+" (if <i>X</i><sub>2</sub> were "-", then
              <i>X</i><sub>1</sub>*<i>X</i><sub>2</sub> with <i>X</i><sub>1</sub> = "+" would yield
              <i>X</i><sub>1</sub>*<i>X</i><sub>2</sub> = "-").
              <p>
              In general, if <i>X</i><sub>1</sub> is important, <i>X</i><sub>1</sub>*<i>X</i><sub>2</sub>
              is important, and <i>X</i><sub>2</sub> is not important, then
              there are four distinct cases for deciding
              what the best setting is for <i>X</i><sub>2</sub>:
              <ul>
              <table noborder>
                 <tr>
                   <td valign=top align=center>
                      <i>X</i><sub>1</sub>

                   <td valign=top align=center>
                      => <i>X</i><sub>2</sub>

              By similar reasoning, examining each factor and pair of
              factors, we thus arrive at a resulting vector of the
              <i>k</i> best settings:
              <p>
              <ul>
                 (x1best, x2best, ..., xkbest)
              </ul>
              <p>
              This average-based <i>k</i>-vector should be compared
              with best settings <i>k</i>-vectors obtained from
              previous steps (in particular, from step 1 in which the
              best settings were drawn from the best data value).
              <p>
              When the average-based best settings and the data-based
              best settings agree, we benefit from the increased
              confidence given our conclusions.
              <p>
              When the average-based best settings and the
              data-based best settings disagree, then what settings
              should the analyst finally choose?  Note that in general
              the average-based settings and the data-based settings
              will invariably be identical for all "important" factors.
              Factors that do differ are virtually always
              "unimportant".  Given such disagreement,
              the analyst has three options:
              <p>
              <ol>
                 <li>Use the average-based settings for minor
                     factors.  This has the advantage of a broader
                     (average) base of support.
                 <li>Use the data-based settings for minor factors.
                     This has the advantage of demonstrated local
                    optimality.
                 <li>Use the cheaper or more convenient settings for
                     the local factor.  This has the advantage of
                     practicality.
              </ol>
              <p>
       </ol>
       <p>
       Thus the interaction effects matrix yields important
       information not only about the ranked list of factors, but
       also about the best settings for each of the <i>k</i> main
       factors.  This matrix of subplots is one of the most important
       tools for the experimenter in the analysis of 2-level
       screening designs.
       <p>
   <li><b>Confounding Structure (for Fractional Factorial Designs)</b>
      <p>
      When the interaction effects matrix is used to analyze
      2-level fractional (as opposed to full) factorial designs,
      important additional information can be extracted from the
      matrix regarding confounding structure.
      <p>
      It is well-known that all fractional factorial designs have
      confounding, a property whereby every estimated main effect is
      confounded/contaminated/biased by some high-order
      interactions.  The practical effect of this is that the analyst
      is unsure of how much of the estimated main effect is due to the
      main factor itself and how much is due
      to some confounding interaction.  Such contamination is the price
      that is paid by examining <i>k</i> factors with a sample size
      <i>n</i> that is less than a full factorial
      <i>n</i> = 2<sup><i>k</i></sup> runs.
      <p>
      It is a "fundamental theorem" of the discipline of experimental
      design that for a given number of factors <i>k</i> and a given
      number of runs <i>n</i>, some fractional factorial designs are
      better than others.  "Better" in this case means that the
      intrinsic confounding that <b>must</b> exist in all
      fractional factorial designs has been minimized by the choice
      of design.  This minimization is done by constructing the design
      so that the main effect confounding is pushed to as high an
      order interaction as possible.
      <p>
      The rationale behind this is that in physical science and
      engineering systems it has been found that the
      "likelihood" of high-order interactions being significant is
      small (compared to the likelihood of main effects and 2-factor
      interactions being significant).  Given this, we would prefer
      that such inescapable main effect confounding be with the highest
      order interaction possible, and hence the bias to the estimated
      main effect be as small as possible.
      <p>
      The worst designs are those in which the main effect confounding
      is with 2-factor interactions.  This may be dangerous
      because in physical/engineering systems, it is quite common for
      Nature to have some real (and large) 2-factor interactions.  In
      such a case, the 2-factor interaction effect will be inseparably
      entangled with some estimated main effect, and so the experiment
      will be flawed in that
      <p>
      <ol>
         <li>ambiguous estimated main effects and
         <li>an ambiguous list of ranked factors
      </ol>
      <p>
      will result.
      <p>
      If the number of factors, <i>k</i>, is large and the
      number of runs, <i>n</i>, is constrained to be small, then
      confounding of main effects with 2-factor interactions is
      unavoidable.  For example, if we have <i>k</i> = 7 factors and
      can afford only <i>n</i> = 8 runs, then the corresponding
      2-level fractional factorial design is a 2<sup>7-4</sup>
      which necessarily will have main effects confounded with (3)
      2-factor interactions.  This cannot be avoided.
      <p>
      On the other hand, situations arise in which 2-factor interaction
      confounding with main effects results not from constraints on
      <i>k</i> or <i>n</i>, but on poor design construction.  For
      example, if we have <i>k</i> = 7 factors and can afford <i>n</i>
      = 16 runs, a poorly constructed design might have main effects
      counfounded with 2-factor interactions, but a well-constructed
      design with the
      same <i>k</i> = 7, <i>n</i> = 16 would have main effects
      confounded with 3-factor interactions but <b>no</b> 2-factor
      interactions.  Clearly, this latter design is preferable in
      terms of minimizing main effect confounding/contamination/bias.
      <p>
      For those cases in which we do have main effects confounded
      with 2-factor interactions, an important question arises:
      <p>
      <ul>
         For a particular main effect of interest,
         how do we know which 2-factor interaction(s)
         confound/contaminate that main effect?
      </ul>
      <p>
      The usual answer to this question is by means of generator theory,
      confounding tables, or alias charts.  An alternate complementary
      approach is given by the interaction effects matrix.  In
      particular, if we are examining a 2-level fractional factorial
      design and
      <p>
      <ol>
         <li>if we are not sure that the design has main effects
             confounded with 2-factor interactions, or
         <li>if we are sure that we have such 2-factor
             interaction confounding but are not sure
             what effects are confounded,
      </ol>
      <p>
      then how can the interaction effects matrix be of assistance?
      The answer to this question is that the confounding structure
      can be read <b>directly</b> from the interaction effects matrix.
      <p>
      For example, for a 7-factor experiment, if, say, the factor
      <i>X</i><sub>3</sub> is confounded with the 2-factor interaction
      <i>X</i><sub>2</sub>*<i>X</i><sub>5</sub>, then
      <p>
      <ol>
         <li>the appearance of the factor <i>X</i><sub>3</sub> subplot
             and the appearance of the 2-factor
             interaction <i>X</i><sub>2</sub>*<i>X</i><sub>5</sub> subplot will
             necessarily be identical, and
         <li>the value of the estimated main effect for <i>X</i><sub>3</sub>
             (as given in the legend of the main effect subplot) and
             the value of the estimated 2-factor interaction effect for
             <i>X</i><sub>2</sub>*<i>X</i><sub>5</sub> (as given in the legend of the
             2-factor interaction subplot) will also necessarily be
             identical.
      </ol>
      <p>
      The above conditions are necessary, but not sufficient for the
      effects to be confounded.
      <p>
      Hence, in the abscence of tabular descriptions (from your
      statistical software program) of the confounding structure, the
      interaction effect matrix offers the following graphical
      alternative for deducing confounding structure in fractional
      factorial designs:
      <p>
      <ol>
         <li>scan the main factors along the diagonal subplots and
             choose the subset of factors that are "important".
         <li>For each of the "important" factors, scan all of the
             2-factor interactions and compare the main factor subplot
             and estimated effect with each 2-factor interaction
             subplot and estimated effect.
         <li>If there is no match, this implies that the main effect
             is <b>not</b> confounded with any 2-factor interaction.
         <li>If there is a match, this implies that the main
             effect <b>may</b> be confounded with that 2-factor
             interaction.
         <li>If none of the main effects are confounded with any
             2-factor interactions, we can have high confidence in the
             integrity (non-contamination) of our estimated main
             effects.
         <li>In practice, for highly-fractionated designs, each main
             effect may be confounded with several 2-factor
             interactions.  For example, for a 2<sup>7-4</sup>
             fractional factorial design, each main effect will be
             confounded with three 2-factor interactions.  These
             1 + 3 = 4 identical subplots will be blatantly obvious
             in the interaction effects matrix.
      </ol>
      <p>
      Finally, what happens in the case in which the design
      the main effects are <b>not</b> confounded with 2-factor
      interactions (<b>no</b> diagonal subplot matches any off-diagonal
      subplot).  In such a case, does the interaction effects matrix
      offer any useful further insight and information?
      <p>
      The answer to this question is yes because even though such
      designs have main effects unconfounded with 2-factor interactions,
      it is fairly common for such designs to have 2-factor interactions
      confounded with one another, and on occasion it may be of
      interest to the analyst to understand that confounding.  A
      specific example of such a design is a 2<sup>4-1</sup> design
      formed with <i>X</i><sub>4</sub> settings = <i>X</i><sub>1</sub>*<i>X</i><sub>2</sub>*<i>X</i><sub>3</sub>.
      In this case, the 2-factor-interaction confounding structure may
      be deduced by comparing all of the 2-factor interaction subplots
      (and effect estimates) with one another.  Identical subplots and
      effect estimates hint strongly that the two 2-factor interactions
      are confounded.  As before, such comparisons provide necessary
      (but not sufficient) conditions for confounding.  Most statistical
      software for analyzing fractional factorial experiments will
      explicitly list the confounding structure.

The application of the interaction effects matrix plot to the
defective springs data set results in the following conclusions:
<ol>
   <li>Ranked list of factors (including 2-factor interactions):
       <p>
       <ol>
          <li><i>X</i><sub>1</sub>    (estimated effect = 23.0)
          <li><i>X</i><sub>1</sub>*<i>X</i><sub>3</sub> (estimated effect = 10.0)
          <li><i>X</i><sub>2</sub>    (estimated effect = -5.0)
          <li><i>X</i><sub>3</sub>    (estimated effect =  1.5)
          <li><i>X</i><sub>1</sub>*<i>X</i><sub>2</sub> (estimated effect =  1.5)
          <li><i>X</i><sub>2</sub>*<i>X</i><sub>3</sub> (estimated effect =  0.0)
       </ol>
       <p>
       Factor 1 definitely looks important.  The <i>X</i><sub>1</sub>*<i>X</i><sub>3</sub>
       interaction looks important.  Factor 2 is of lesser importance.
       All other factors and 2-factor interactions appear to be
       unimportant.
       <p>
   <li>Best Settings (on the average):
       <p>
       <ul>
          (<i>X</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>X</i><sub>2</sub>, <i>X</i><sub>3</sub>) = (+, -, +) = (+1, -1, +1)

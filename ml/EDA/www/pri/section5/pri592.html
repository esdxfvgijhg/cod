Purpose
</I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%>
<!-- Add main text below -->
The DOE (design of experiments) scatter plot answers the following
three questions:
<ol>
   <li>What are the most important factors?
   <li>What is the best setting for each of these important factors?
   <li>What data points are outliers?
</ol>
In the above questions, the terms "important", "best", and
"outliers" need clarification and specificity:
<p>
<a name="important">
<b>Important</b>
</a>
<p>
A factor can be "important" if it leads to a significant shift
in either the location or the variation of the response variable
as we go from the "-" setting to the "+" setting
of the factor.  Both definitions are relevant and acceptable.  The
default definition of "important" in engineering/scientific
applications is a shift in location.  Unless specified otherwise,
when a factor is claimed to be important, the implication is
that the factor caused a large location shift in the response.
<p>
<a name="best">
<b>Best</b>
</a>
<p>
A factor setting is "best" if it results in a typical response
that is closest, in location, to the desired project goal
(maximization, minimization, target).  This desired project goal
is an engineering, not a statistical, question, and so the desired
optimization goal must be specified by the engineer.
<p>
<a name="outlier">
<b>Outlier</b>
</a>
<p>
A data point is an "outlier" if it comes from a different
probability distribution or from a different deterministic model
than the remainder of the data.  A single outlier in a data set
can affect all effect estimates and so in turn can potentially
invalidate the factor rankings in terms of importance.
<p>
Given the above definitions, the DOE scatter plot is a useful
early-step tool for determining the important factors, best
settings, and outliers.  An alternate name for the DOE scatter
plot is "main effects plot".

<TD WIDTH=85%>
<!-- Add main text below -->
The DOE scatter plot is formed by
<ul>
   <li>Vertical Axis: The response (= the raw data) for a given
       setting (- or +) of a factor for each of the <i>k</i>
       factors.
       <p>
   <li>Horizontal Axis: The <i>k</i> factors, and the two settings
       (- and +) within each factor.
</ul>

Motivation
</I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%>
<!-- Add main text below -->
The scatter plot is the primary data analysis tool for determining
if and how a response relates to another factor.  Determining if
such a relationship exists is a necessary first step in converting
statistical association to possible engineering cause-and-effect.
Looking at how the raw data change as a function of
the different levels of a factor is a fundamental step which, it
may be argued, should never be skipped in any data analysis.
<p>
From such a foundational plot, the analyst invariably extracts
information dealing with location shifts, variation shifts, and
outliers.  Such information may easily be washed out by other
"more advanced" quantitative or graphical procedures (even
computing and plotting means!).  Hence there is motivation for the
DOE scatter plot.
<p>
If we were interested in assessing the importance of a single
factor, and since "important" by default means shift in location,
then the simple scatter plot is an ideal tool.  A large shift (with
little data overlap) in the body of the data from the "-" setting
to the "+" setting of a given factor would imply that the
factor is important.  A small shift (with much overlap) would
imply the factor is not important.
<p>
The DOE scatter plot is actually a sequence of <i>k</i>
such scatter plots with one scatter plot for each factor.

<I>
How to interpret
</I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%>
<!-- Add main text below -->
As discussed previously, the DOE scatter plot is
used to look for the following:
<ol>
   <li>Most Important Factors;
   <li>Best Settings of the Most Important Factors;
   <li>Outliers.
</ol>
Each of these will be discussed in turn.
<p>
<b>Most Important Factors:</b>
<p>
For each of the <i>k</i> factors, as we go from the "-" setting
to the "+" setting within the factor, is there a location shift
in the body of the data?  If yes, then
<ol>
   <li>Which factor has the biggest such data location shift (that
       is, has least data overlap)?  This defines the "most
       important factor".
       <p>
   <li>Which factor has the next biggest shift (that is, has next
       least data overlap)?  This defines the "second most important
       factor".
       <p>
   <li>Continue for the remaining factors.
</ol>
In practice, the DOE scatter plot will typically only be able to
discriminate the most important factor (largest shift) and perhaps
the second most important factor (next largest shift).  The degree
of overlap in remaining factors is frequently too large to
ascertain with certainty the ranking for other factors.
<p>
<b>Best Settings for the Most Important Factors:</b>
<p>
For each of the most important factors, which
setting ("-" or "+") yields the "best" response?
<p>
In order to answer this question, the engineer must first define "best".
This is done with respect to the overall project goal in
conjunction with the specific response variable under study.  For
some experiments (e.g., maximizing the speed of a chip), "best"
means we are trying to maximize the response (speed).  For other
experiments (e.g., semiconductor chip scrap), "best" means we are
trying to minimize the response (scrap).  For yet other experiments
(e.g., designing a resistor) "best" means we are trying to hit a
specific target (the specified resistance).  Thus the definition of
"best" is an engineering precursor to the determination of best
settings.
<p>
Suppose the analyst is attempting to maximize the response.  In such a
case, the analyst would proceed as follows:
<ol>
   <li>For factor 1, for what setting (- or +) is the body of the
       data higher?
   <li>For factor 2, for what setting (- or +) is the body of the
       data higher?
   <li>Continue for the remaining factors.
</ol>
The resulting <i>k</i>-vector of best settings:
<ul>
   (x1best, x2best, ..., xkbest)
</ul>
is thus theoretically obtained by looking at each factor
individually in the DOE scatter plot and choosing the setting
(- or +) that has the body of data closest to the desired
optimal (maximal, minimal, target) response.
<p>
As indicated earlier, the DOE scatter plot will typically be able to
estimate best settings for only the first few important factors.
Again, the degree of data overlap precludes ascertaining best
settings for the remaining factors.  Other tools, such as the
<a href-"pri593.htm">DOE mean plot</a>, will do a better job of
determining such settings.  
<p>
<b>Outliers:</b>
<p>
Do any data points stand apart from the bulk of the data?  If so,
then such values are candidates for further investigation as
outliers.  For multiple outliers, it is of interest to note if
all such anomalous data cluster at the same setting for any of
the various factors.  If so, then such settings become candidates
for avoidance or inclusion, depending on the nature (bad or 
good), of the outliers.

Conclusions for the defective springs data
</I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%>
<!-- Add main text below -->
The application of the DOE scatter plot to the defective springs
data set results in the following conclusions:
<ol>
   <li>Most Important Factors:
       <p>
       <ol>
          <li><i>X</i><sub>1</sub>  (most important);
          <li><i>X</i><sub>2</sub>  (of lesser importance);
          <li><i>X</i><sub>3</sub>  (of least importance).
       </ol>
       <p>
       that is,
       <p>
       <ul>
          <li>factor 1 definitely looks important;
          <li>factor 2 is a distant second;
          <li>factor 3 has too much overlap to be important
              with respect to location, but is flagged for further
              investigation due to potential differences in
              variation.
       </ul>
       <p>
   <li>Best Settings:
       <p>
       <ul>
          (<i>X</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>X</i><sub>2</sub>, <i>X</i><sub>3</sub>) = (+, -, -) = (+1, -1, -1)
       </ul>
       <p>
   <li>Outliers: None detected.
</ol>

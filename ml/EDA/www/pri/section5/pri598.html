Purpose

</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%>
<!-- Add main text below -->
The half-normal probability plot answers the question:
<ul>
   What are the important factors (including interactions)?
</ul>
Quantitatively, the estimated effect of a given main effect or
interaction and its rank relative to other main effects and interactions
is given via <a href="../../eda/section3/eda35i.html">least squares
estimation</a> (that is, forming effect estimates that minimize the
sum of the squared differences between raw data and the fitted values
from such estimates).  Having such estimates in hand, one could then
construct a list of the main effects and interactions ordered by the
effect magnitude.
<p>
The half-normal probability plot is a graphical tool that uses these
ordered estimated effects to help assess which factors are
important and which are unimportant.
<p>
A half-normal distribution is the distribution of the |<i>X</i>| with
<i>X</i> having a <a href="../../eda/section3/eda3661.html">normal</a>
distribution.

Definition

<TD WIDTH=85%>
<!-- Add main text below -->
A half-normal probability plot is formed by
<ul>
   <li>Vertical Axis: Ordered (largest to smallest) absolute value of
       the estimated effects for the main factors and available
       interactions.  If <i>n</i> data points (no replication) have
       been collected, then typically (<i>n</i>-1) effects will be
       estimated and the (<i>n</i>-1) |effects| will be plotted.
       <p>
   <li>Horizontal Axis: (<i>n</i>-1) theoretical order statistic
       medians from a half-normal distribution.  These (<i>n</i>-1)
       values are not data-dependent.  They depend only on the
       half-normal distribution and the number of items plotted
       (= <i>n</i>-1).  The theoretical medians represent an "ideal"
       typical ordered data set that would have been obtained from a
       random drawing of (<i>n</i>-1) samples from a half-normal
       distribution.
       <p>
   <li>Far right margin : Factor/interaction identification:
       <ul>
          1 indicates factor <i>X</i><sub>1</sub>;<br>
          2 indicates factor <i>X</i><sub>2</sub>;<br>
          ...<br>
          12 indicates the 2-factor <i>X</i><sub>1</sub>*<i>X</i><sub>2</sub> interaction<br>
          123 indicates the 3-factor <i>X</i><sub>1</sub>*<i>X</i><sub>2</sub>*<i>X</i><sub>3</sub>
          interaction,<br>
          etc.<br>
       </ul>
       <p>
       If the design is a fractional factorial, the confounding
       structure is provided for main effects and 2-factor interactions.

Motivation
</I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%>
<!-- Add main text below -->
To provide a rationale for the half-normal probability plot,
we first dicuss the motivation for the normal probability
plot (which also finds frequent use in these 2-level designs).
<p>
The basis for the <a href="../../eda/section3/normprpl.html">normal
probability plot</a> is the mathematical form for each (and all) of
the estimated effects.  As
discussed for the <a href="pri597.html">|effects| plot</a>,
the estimated effects are the optimal least squares estimates.  Because
of the orthogonality of the 2<sup><i>k</i></sup> full factorial and
the 2<sup><i>k</i>-<i>p</i></sup> fractional factorial designs, all
least squares estimators for main effects and interactions
simplify to the form:
<ul>
   estimated effect =
   <!-- <img align=bottom src="eqns/ybar.gif" alt="ybar"> -->
   \( \bar{Y} \)(+) -
   <!-- <img align=bottom src="eqns/ybar.gif" alt="ybar"> -->
   \( \bar{Y} \)(-)
</ul>
with <!-- <img align=bottom src="eqns/ybar.gif" alt="ybar"> -->
\( \bar{Y} \)(+) the average of all response values for which the factor
or interaction takes on a "+" value, and where
<!-- <img align=bottom src="eqns/ybar.gif" alt="ybar"> -->
\( \bar{Y} \)(-) is the average of all response values for which the
factor or interaction takes on a "-" value.
<p>
Under rather general conditions, the Central Limit Thereom allows
that the difference-of-sums form for the estimated effects tends
to follow a normal distribution (for a large enough sample size
<i>n</i>) a normal distribution.
<!-- Hence each
estimated effect tends to have a normal distribution, and the
collection of such estimated effects tends to behave like a set of
data from a normal distribution.
 -->
<p>
The question arises as to what normal distribution; that is, a normal
distribution with what mean and what standard deviation? Since all
estimators have an identical form (a difference of averages), the
standard deviations, though unknown, will in fact be the same under
the assumption of constant <i>&sigma;</i>.  This is good in that it
simplifies the normality analysis.
<p>
As for the means, however, there will be differences from one effect
to the next, and these differences depend on whether a factor is
unimportant or important.  <b>Unimportant</b> factors
are those that have near-zero effects and <b>important</b> factors are
those whose effects are considerably removed from zero.  Thus,
<b>unimportant</b> effects tend to have a normal distribution centered
near zero while <b>important</b> effects tend to have a normal
distribution centered at their respective true large (but unknown)
effect values.
<p>
In the simplest experimental case, if the experiment were such that no
factors were important (that is, all effects were near zero), the
(<i>n</i>-1) estimated effects would behave like random drawings from
a normal distribution centered at zero.  We can test for such normality
(and hence test for a null-effect experiment) by using the
<a href="../../eda/section3/normprpl.html">normal probability plot</a>.
Normal probability plots are easy to interpret.  In simplest terms:
<ul>
   if linear, then normal
</ul>
If the normal probability plot of the (<i>n</i>-1) estimated effects
is linear, this implies that all of the true (unknown) effects
are zero or near-zero.  That is, no factor is important.
<p>
On the other hand, if the truth behind the experiment is that there
is exactly one factor that was important (that is, significantly
non-zero), and all remaining factors are unimportant (that is,
near-zero), then the normal probability plot of all (<i>n</i>-1)
effects is near-linear for the (<i>n</i>-2) unimportant factors
and the remaining single important factor would stand well off the line.
<p>
Similarly, if the experiment were such that some subset of factors were
important and all remaining factors were unimportant, then the normal
probability plot of all (<i>n</i>-1) effects would be near-linear for
all unimportant factors with the remaining important factors all well
off the line.
<p>
In real life, with the number of important factors unknown, this
suggests that one could form a normal probability plot of the
(<i>n</i>-1) estimated effects and draw a line through those
(unimportant) effects in the vicinity of zero.  This identifies and
extracts all remaining effects off the line and declares them
as important.
<p>
The above rationale and methodology works well in practice, with the
net effect that the normal probability plot of the effects is an
important, commonly used and successfully employed tool for
identifying important factors in 2-level full and factorial
experiments.  Following the lead of
<a href="../section8/pri8.html#Daniel">Cuthbert Daniel (1976)</a>,
we augment the methodology and arrive at a further improvement.
Specifically, the sign of each estimate is completely arbitrary and
will reverse depending on how the initial assignments were made
(e.g., we could assign "-" to treatment A and "+" to treatment
B or just as easily assign "+" to treatment A and "-" to
treatment B).
<p>
This arbitrariness is addressed by dealing with the effect magnitudes
rather than the signed effects.  If the signed effects follow a
normal distribution, the absolute values of the effects follow
a half-normal distribution.
<p>
In this new context, one tests for important versus unimportant
factors by generating a half-normal probability plot of the
absolute value of the effects.  As before, linearity implies
half-normality, which in turn implies all factors are unimportant.
More typically, however, the half-normal probability plot will be only
partially linear.  Unimportant (that is, near-zero) effects manifest
themselves as being near zero and on a line while important (that is,
large) effects manifest themselves by being off the line and
well-displaced from zero.

How to interpret

<TD WIDTH=85%>
<!-- Add main text below -->
From the half-normal probability plot, we look for the following:
<ol>
   <li>Identifying Important Factors:
       <p>
       Determining the subset of important factors is the most
       important task of the half-normal probability plot of |effects|.
       As discussed above, the estimated |effect| of an
       <b>un</b>important factor will typically be on or close to a
       near-zero line, while the estimated |effect| of an important
       factor will typically be displaced well off the line.
       <p>
       The separation of factors into important/unimportant categories
       is thus done by answering the question:
       <p>
       <ul>
          Which points on the half-normal probability plot
          of |effects| are large and well-off the linear
          collection of points drawn in the vicinity of
          the origin?
       </ul>
       <p>
       This line of unimportant factors typically encompasses the
       majority of the points on the plot.  The procedure consists,
       therefore, of the following:
       <p>
       <ol>
          <li>identifying this line of near-zero (unimportant) factors;
              then
          <li>declaring the remaining off-line factors as important.
       </ol>
       <p>
       Note that the half-normal probability plot of |effects| and
       the <a href="pri597.html">|effects| plot</a> have the same
       vertical axis; namely, the ordered |effects|, so the following
       discussion about right-margin factor identifiers is relevant to
       both plots.  As a consequence of the natural on-line/off-line
       segregation of the |effects| in half-normal probability plots,
       factors off-line tend to have far-right labels that are
       distinct and isolated while factors near the line tend to have
       far-right labels that are overstruck and hard to read.
       The rough rule-of-thumb would then be to declare as important
       those factors/interactions whose far-right labels are easy to
       distinguish and to declare as unimportant those
       factors/interactions whose far-right labels are overwritten and
       hard to distinguish.
       <p>
   <li>Ranked List of Factors (including interactions):
       <p>
       This is a minor objective of the half-normal probability plot
       (it is better done via the <a href="pri597.html">|effects|
       plot</a>).  To determine the ranked list of factors from a
       half-normal probability plot, simply scan the
       vertical axis |effects|
       <p>
       <ol>
          <li>Which |effect| is largest? Note the factor identifier
              associated with this largest |effect|  (this is the
             "most important factor").
             <p>
          <li>Which |effect| is next in size?  Note the factor
              identifier associated with this next largest |effect|
              (this is the "second most important factor").
             <p>
          <li>Continue for the remaining factors.  In practice, the
              bottom end of the ranked list (the unimportant factors)
              will be hard to extract because of overstriking, but the
              top end of the ranked list (the important factors) will
              be easy to determine.
       </ol>
</ol>
In summary, it should be noted that since the signs of the
estimated effects are arbitrary, we recommend the use of the
half-normal probability plot of |effects| technique over the normal
probability plot of the |effects|.  These probability plots are among
the most commonly-employed EDA procedure for identification of
important factors in 2-level full and factorial designs.  The
half-normal probability plot enjoys widespread usage across both
"classical" and Taguchi camps.  It deservedly plays an important role
in our recommended 10-step graphical procedure for the analysis of
2-level designed experiments.

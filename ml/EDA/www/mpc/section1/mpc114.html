Variability is the tendency of the measurement process to produce
slightly different measurements on the same test item, where conditions
of measurement are either stable or vary over time, temperature,
operators, etc. In this chapter we consider two sources of
time-dependent variability:
<UL>
   <LI>Short-term variability ascribed to the precision of the
       instrument
   <LI>Long-term variability related to changes in environment and
       handling techniques
</UL>

<A NAME="short">Short-term errors affect the precision of the
instrument. Even very precise instruments exhibit small changes caused
by random errors. It is useful to think in terms of measurements
performed with a single instrument over minutes or hours; this is 
to be understood, normally, as the time that it takes to complete 
a measurement sequence.

Four terms are in common usage to describe short-term phenomena. They
are interchangeable.

<I>Precision is quantified by a standard deviation</I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%><!-- Add main text below -->
The measure of precision is a standard deviation.  Good precision
implies a small standard deviation. This standard deviation is called
the short-term standard deviation of the process or the repeatability
standard deviation.

<I>Caution<B> -- </B>long-term variability may be dominant</I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%><!-- Add main text below -->
<A NAME="long">With very precise instrumentation, it is not unusual to
find that the variability exhibited by the measurement process from
day-to-day often exceeds the precision of the instrument because of
small changes in environmental conditions and handling techniques
which cannot be controlled or corrected in the measurement process.
The measurement process is not completely characterized until this
source of variability is quantified.

<I>Terminology</I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%><!-- Add main text below -->
Three terms are in common usage to describe long-term phenomena.  They
are interchangeable.
<OL>
   <LI>day-to-day variability
   <LI>long-term variability
   <LI>reproducibility 
</OL>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top><!-- Add marginal notes below -->
<I>Caution -- regarding term 'reproducibility'</I>
</TD><TD WIDTH=85%>
The term 'reproducibility' is given very specific definitions in some
national and international standards.  However, the definitions are
not always in agreement.  Therefore, it is used here only in a generic
sense to indicate variability across days.

<TR>
<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top><!-- Add marginal notes below -->
<I>Definitions in this Handbook</I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%>
We adopt precise definitions and provide data collection and analysis
techniques in the sections on <A HREF="mpc12.html">check standards</A>
and <A HREF="../section2/mpc2.html">measurement control</A> for
estimating:
<P>
<UL>
   <LI><A HREF="mpc123.html">Level-1 standard deviation for short-term
       variability</A>
   <LI><A HREF="mpc123.html">Level-2 standard deviation for day-to-day
       variability</A>
</UL>
<P>
In the section on <A HREF="../section4/mpc4.html">gauge studies</A>,
the concept of variability is extended to include very long-term
measurement variability:
<UL>
   <LI><A HREF="../section4/mpc441.html">Level-1 standard deviation</A>
       for short-term variability
   <LI><A HREF="../section4/mpc442.html">Level-2 standard deviation</A>
       for day-to-day variability
   <LI><A HREF="../section4/mpc443.html">Level-3 standard deviation</A>
       for very long-term variability  
</UL>
We refer to the standard deviations associated with these three kinds
of uncertainty as "Level 1, 2, and 3 standard deviations", respectively.

<TR>
<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top><!-- Add marginal notes below -->
<I>Long-term variability is quantified by a standard deviation</I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%><!-- Add main text below -->
The measure of long-term variability is the standard deviation of
measurements taken over several days, weeks or months.
<P>
The simplest method for doing this assessment is by analysis of a
<A HREF="mpc12.html">check standard </A>database.  The measurements on
the check standards are structured to cover a long time interval and to
capture all sources of variation in the measurement process.

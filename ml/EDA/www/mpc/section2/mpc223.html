Once the baseline and control limits for the control chart have been
determined from historical data, and any bad observations removed and
the control limits recomputed, the measurement process enters the
monitoring stage.  A <A HREF="mpc221.html">Shewhart control chart</A> and
<A HREF="mpc2211.html">EWMA control chart</A> for monitoring a mass
calibration process are shown below.  For the purpose of comparing the
two techniques, the two control charts are based on the same data where
the baseline and control limits are computed from the data taken prior
to 1985.  The monitoring stage begins at the start of 1985.  Similarly,
the control limits for both charts are 3-standard deviation limits.
The <A HREF="../section3/mpc3521.html">check standard data and 
analysis</A> are explained more fully in another section.

In the EWMA control chart below, the control data after 1985 are shown
in green, and the EWMA statistics are shown as black dots superimposed
on the raw data.  The EWMA statistics, and not the raw data, are of
interest in looking for out-of-control signals.  Because the EWMA
statistic is a weighted average, it has a smaller standard deviation
than a single control measurement, and, therefore, the EWMA control
limits are narrower than the limits for the Shewhart control chart
shown above.

The control strategy is based on the predictability of future
measurements from historical data. Each new check standard measurement
is plotted on the control chart in real time.  These values are
expected to fall within the control limits if the process has not
changed.  Measurements that exceed the control limits are probably
out-of-control and require remedial action.  Possible causes of
out-of-control signals need to be understood when developing strategies
for dealing with outliers.

<I>Signs of significant trends or shifts</I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%>
The control chart should be viewed in its entirety on a regular basis]
to identify drift or shift in the process.  In the Shewhart control
chart shown above, only a few points exceed the control limits.
The small, but significant, shift in the process that occurred after
1985 can only be identified by examining the plot of control
measurements over time.  A <A HREF="../section3/mpc3521.html">re-analysis
of the kilogram check standard data</A> shows that the control limits
for the Shewhart control chart should be updated based on the the data
after 1985.  In the EWMA control chart, multiple violations of the
control limits occur after 1986.  In the calibration environment, the
incidence of several violations should alert the control engineer that
a shift in the process has occurred, possibly because of damage or
change in the value of a reference standard, and the process requires
review.

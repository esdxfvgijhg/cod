<I>Advantages of nested designs</I>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=85%>
A nested design is recommended for studying the effect of sources of
variability that manifest themselves over time.  Data collection and
analysis are straightforward, and there is no reason to estimate
interaction terms when dealing with time-dependent errors.  Nested
designs can be run at several levels.  Three levels are recommended
for measurement systems where sources of error are not well understood
and have not previously been studied.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top>
<I>Time intervals in a nested design</I>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=85%>
The following levels are based on the characteristics of many
measurement systems and should be adapted to a specific measurement
situation as need be.  A typical design is shown below.
<UL>
   <LI>Level-1 Measurements taken over a short-time to capture the
       precision of the gauge 
       <P>
   <LI>Level-2 Measurements taken over days (or other appropriate time
       increment)
       <P>
   <LI>Level-3 Measurements taken over runs separated by months
</UL>
</TD>

<I>Definition of number of measurements at each level</I>

The following symbols are defined for this chapter:

   <LI>Level-2 <I>K (K > 2)</I> days
   <LI>Level-3 <I>L (L > 2)</I> runs

   <LI><I>I (I > 3)</I> gauges if the intent is to characterize
       several similar gauges

The design can be truncated at <A HREF="mpc432.html">two levels</A> to
estimate <A HREF="mpc441.html">repeatability</A> and 
<A HREF="mpc442.html">day-to-day variability</A> if there is no reason
to estimate longer-term effects.  The analysis remains the same through
the first two levels.

<I>Advantages</I>
</TD>
<TD><!-- Add main text below -->
This design has advantages in ease of use and computation.  The number
of repetitions at each level need not be large because information is
being gathered on several check standards. 
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top><!-- Add marginal notes below -->
<I>Operator considerations </I>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=85%>
The measurements should be made with <I>ONE</I> operator.
Operator is not usually a consideration with automated systems.
However, systems that require decisions regarding line edge or other
feature delineations may be operator dependent.  If there is reason to
believe that results might differ significantly by operator,
'operators' can be substituted for 'runs' in the design. Choose
<I>L (L > 2)</I> operators at random from the pool of operators who are
capable of making measurements at the same level of precision. (Conduct
a small experiment with operators making repeatability measurements, if
necessary, to verify comparability of precision among operators.)  Then
complete the data collection and analysis as outlined.  In this case,
the <A HREF="mpc443.html">level-3 standard deviation </A>estimates
operator effect. 
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top>
<I>Caution</I>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=85%>
Be sure that the design is truly nested; i.e., that each operator
reports results for the same set of circumstances, particularly with
regard to day of measurement so that each operator measures every day,
or every other day, and so forth. 
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top>
<I>Randomize on gauges</I>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=85%><!-- Add main text below -->
Randomize with respect to gauges for each check standard; i.e., choose
the first check standard and randomize the gauges; choose the second
check standard and randomize gauges; and so forth.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top>
<I>Record results in a file</I>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=85%><!-- Add main text below -->
Record the <A HREF="mpc44.html"> average and standard deviation</A>
from each group of <I>J</I> repetitions by:
<UL>
   <LI>check standard
   <LI>gauge
</UL>

<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=85%><!-- Add main text below -->
Results should be recorded along with pertinent environmental
readings and identifications for significant factors.  The best way
to record this information is in one file with one line or row (on
a spreadsheet) of information in fixed fields for each check standard
measurement. A list of typical entries follows.
<OL>
   <LI>Month
   <LI>Day
   <LI>Year
   <LI>Operator identification
   <LI>Check standard identification
   <LI>Gauge identification
   <LI>Average of J repetitions
   <LI>Short-term standard deviation from <I>J</I> repetitions
   <LI>Degrees of freedom
   <LI>Environmental readings (if pertinent)
</OL>

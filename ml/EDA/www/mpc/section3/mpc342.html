<I>Tie to the defined unit of length</I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%><!-- Add main text below -->
The unit of length in many industries is maintained and disseminated
by gauge blocks. The highest accuracy calibrations of gauge blocks are
done by laser intererometry which allows the transfer of the unit of
length to a gauge piece.  Primary standards laboratories maintain
master sets of English gauge blocks and metric gauge blocks which are
calibrated in this manner.  Gauge blocks ranging in sizes from 0.1 to 20
inches are required to support industrial processes in the United
States.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top><!-- begin paragraph -->
<I>Mechanical comparison of gauge blocks</I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%>
However, the majority of gauge blocks are calibrated by comparison with
master gauges using a mechanical comparator specifically designed for
measuring the small difference between two blocks of the same nominal
length.  The measurements are temperature corrected from readings taken
directly on the surfaces of the blocks.  Measurements on 2 to 20 inch
blocks require special handling techniques to minimize thermal effects.
A typical calibration involves a set of 81 gauge blocks which are
compared one-by-one with master gauges of the same nominal size.

</TR>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top><!-- end paragraph -->
<I>Calibration designs for gauge blocks</I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%><!-- Add main text below -->
Calibration designs allow comparison of several gauge blocks of the
same nominal size to one master gauge in a manner that promotes economy
of operation and minimizes wear on the master gauge.  The calibration
design is repeated for each size until measurements on all the blocks
in the test sets are completed.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top><!-- end paragraph -->
<I>Problem of thermal drift</I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%><!-- Add main text below -->
Measurements on gauge blocks are subject to drift from heat build-up
in the comparator.  This drift must be accounted for in the calibration
experiment or the lengths assigned to the blocks will be contaminated
by the drift term.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top><!-- end paragraph -->
<I>Elimination of linear drift</I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%>
The designs in this catalog are constructed so that the solutions are
immune to linear drift if the measurements are equally spaced over time.
The size of the drift is the average of the <i>n</i> difference
measurements.  Keeping track of drift from design to design is useful
because a marked change from its usual range of values may indicate a
problem with the measurement system.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top><!-- end paragraph -->
<I>Assumption for Doiron designs </I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%><!-- Add main text below -->
Mechanical measurements on gauge blocks take place successively 
with one block being inserted into the comparator followed by a second
block and so on. This scenario leads to the assumption that the
individual measurements are subject to drift 
(<A HREF="../section7/mpc7.html#Doiron">Doiron</A>).
Doiron lists designs meeting this criterion which also allow for:
<UL>
   <LI>two master blocks, <I>R</I><sub>1</sub> and <I>R</I><sub>2</sub> 
   <LI>one check standard = difference between <I>R</I><sub>1</sub> and <I>R</I><sub>2</sub>
   <LI>one - nine test blocks 
</UL>
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top><!-- end paragraph -->
<I>Properties of drift-elimination designs that use 1 master block</I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%>The designs are constructed to:
<UL>
   <LI>Be immune to linear drift
   <LI>Minimize the standard deviations for test blocks (as much as
       possible)
   <LI>Spread the measurements on each block throughout the design
   <LI>Be completed in 5-10 minutes to keep the drift at the 5 nm level
</UL>
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top><!-- end paragraph -->
<I>Caution </I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%><!-- Add main text below -->
Because of the large number of gauge blocks that are being
intercompared and the need to eliminate drift, the Doiron designs are
not completely balanced with respect to the test blocks.  Therefore,
the standard deviations are not equal for all blocks.  If all the
blocks are being calibrated for use in one facility, it is easiest to
quote the largest of the standard deviations for all blocks rather than
try to maintain a separate record on each block.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top><!-- end paragraph -->
<I>Definition of master block and check standard</I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%><!-- Add main text below -->
At the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the
first two blocks in the design are NIST masters which are designated
<I>R</I><sub>1</sub> and <I>R</I><sub>2</sub>, respectively. The 
<I>R</I><sub>1</sub> block is a steel
block, and the <I>R</I><sub>2</sub> block is a chrome-carbide block. If the test
blocks are steel, the reference is <I>R</I><sub>1</sub>; if the test blocks are 
chrome-carbide, the reference is <I>R</I><sub>2</sub>.  The check standard is
always the difference between <I>R</I><sub>1</sub> and <I>R</i><sub>2</sub> as estimated from
the design and is independent of <I>R</I><sub>1</sub> and <I>R</I><sub>2</sub>.  The designs
are listed in this section of the catalog as:

Historical designs for gauge blocks
(<A HREF="../section7/mpc7.html#CameronHailes">Cameron and Hailes</A>)
work on the assumption that the difference measurements are
contaminated by linear drift.  This assumption is more restrictive and
covers the case of drift in successive measurements but produces fewer
designs. The Cameron/Hailes designs meeting this criterion allow for:
<UL>
   <LI>two reference (master) blocks, <I>R</I><sub>1</sub> and <I>R</I><sub>2</sub>
   <LI>check standard = difference between the two master blocks
</UL>
<P>
and assign equal uncertainties to values of all test blocks.

<I>Important concept - check standard</I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85%><!-- Add main text below -->
The <A HREF="../section1/mpc12.html" >check standards </A>for the
designs in this section are not artifact standards but constructions
from the design.  The value of one master block or the average of two
master blocks is the restraint for the design, and values for the
masters, <I>R</I><sub>1</sub> and <I>R</I><sub>2</sub>, are estimated from a set of
measurements taken according to the design. The check standard value
is the difference between the estimates, <I>R</I><sub>1</sub> and <I>R</I><sub>2</sub>.
<A HREF="mpc35.html">Measurement control</A> is exercised by comparing
the current value of the check standard with its historical average.

</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=85%><!-- Add main text below -->
Instrument calibration is intended to eliminate or reduce
<A HREF="../section1/mpc113.html">bias</A> in an instrument's readings
over a range for all continuous values. For this purpose,
<A HREF="../section1/mpc112.html">reference standards </A>with known 
values for selected points covering the range of interest are measured
with the instrument in question. Then a functional relationship is
established between the values of the standards and the corresponding
measurements.  There are two basic situations.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top>
<I>Instruments which require correction for bias</I>
</TD>
<TD>
<UL>
   <LI>The instrument reads in the same units as the reference
       standards. The purpose of the calibration is to identify and
       eliminate any bias in the instrument relative to the defined
       unit of measurement. For example, optical imaging systems that
       measure the width of lines on semiconductors read in micrometers,
       the unit of interest.  Nonetheless, these instruments must be
       calibrated to values of reference standards if line width
       measurements across the industry are to agree with each other.

</TR>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top>
<I>Instruments whose measurements act as surrogates for other
measurements</I>
</TD>
<TD>
<UL>
   <LI>The instrument reads in different units than the reference
       standards. The purpose of the calibration is to convert the
       instrument readings to the units of interest.  An example is
       densitometer measurements that act as surrogates for
       measurements of radiation dosage. For this purpose, reference
       standards are irradiated at several dosage levels and then
       measured by radiometry.  The same reference standards are
       measured by densitometer.  The calibrated results of future
       densitometer readings on medical devices are the basis for
       deciding if the devices have been sterilized at the proper
       radiation level.

<I>Basic steps for correcting the instrument for bias</I>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=85%>
The calibration method is the same for both situations and requires
the following basic steps:
<UL>
   <LI>Selection of reference standards with known values to cover
       the range of interest.
   <LI>Measurements on the reference standards with the instrument to
       be calibrated.
   <LI>Functional relationship between the measured and known values
       of the reference standards (usually a least-squares fit to the
       data) called a <B>calibration curve</B>.
   <LI>Correction of all measurements by the inverse of the
       calibration curve.

<A NAME="plot">A schematic explanation is provided by the figure below 
for load cell calibration.  The <A HREF="mpc3651.html">loadcell
measurements</A> (shown as *) are plotted on the <i>y</i>-axis against
the corresponding values of known load shown on the <i>x</i>-axis.
<P>
A <A HREF="mpc365.html">quadratic fit to the loadcell data</A> produces
the calibration curve that is shown as the solid line.  For a future
measurement with the load cell, <I>Y'</I> = 1.344 on the <i>y</i>-axis,
a dotted line is drawn through <I>Y'</I> parallel to the <i>x</i>-axis.
At the point where it intersects the calibration curve, another
dotted line is drawn parallel to the y-axis. Its point of
intersection with the <i>x</i>-axis at <I>X'</I> = 13.417 is the
calibrated value.

<I>Calibration procedure may fail to eliminate bias</I>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=85%>
There are several circumstances where the calibration curve will not
reduce or eliminate bias as intended.  Some are discussed on this
page.  A critical exploratory analysis of the calibration data should
expose such problems.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top>
<I>Lack of precision </I>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=85%>
Poor instrument precision or unsuspected day-to-day effects may result
in standard deviations that are large enough to jeopardize the
calibration.  There is nothing intrinsic to the calibration procedure
that will improve precision, and the best strategy, before committing
to a particular instrument, is to estimate the instrument's precision
in the environment of interest to decide if it is good enough for the
precision required.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top>
<I>Outliers in the calibration data</I>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=85%>
<A HREF="../../pmd/section4/pmd442.html">Outliers in the calibration
data</A> can seriously distort the calibration curve, particularly if
they lie near one of the endpoints of the calibration interval. 
<UL>
   <LI>Isolated outliers (single points) should be deleted from the
       calibration data. 
   <LI>An entire day's results which are inconsistent with the other
       data should be examined and rectified before proceeding with the
       analysis. 
</UL>
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top>
<I>Systematic differences among operators</I>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=85%>
It is possible for different operators to produce measurements with
biases that differ in sign and magnitude.  This is not usually a
problem for automated instrumentation, but for instruments that depend
on line of sight, results may differ significantly by operator.  To
diagnose this problem, measurements by different operators on the same
artifacts are plotted and compared.  Small differences among operators
can be accepted as part of the imprecision of the measurement process,
but large systematic differences among operators require resolution.
Possible solutions are to retrain the operators or maintain separate
calibration curves by operator.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top>
<I>Lack of system control</I>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=85%>
The calibration procedure, once established, relies on the instrument
continuing to respond in the same way over time.  If the system drifts
or takes unpredictable excursions, the calibrated values may not be
properly corrected for bias, and depending on the direction of change,
the calibration may further degrade the accuracy of the measurements.
To assure that future measurements are properly corrected for bias, the
calibration procedure should be coupled with a 
<A HREF="mpc37.html">statistical control procedure for the instrument</A>.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top>
<I>Example of <A HREF="mpc3641.html">differences among repetitions in
the calibration data</A></I>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=85% VALIGN=TOP>
An important point, but one that is rarely considered, is that there
can be differences in responses from repetition to repetition that
will invalidate the analysis.  A <A HREF="mpc3641.html#plot1">plot of the
aggregate of the calibration data</A> may not identify changes in the
instrument response from day-to-day.  What is needed is a
<A HREF="mpc3641.html#plot2">plot of the fine structure of the 
data</A> that exposes any day to day differences in the calibration
data.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top>
<I><B>Warning</B> - calibration can fail because 
of day-to-day changes</I>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=85% VALIGN=TOP>
A straight-line fit to the aggregate data will produce a 'calibration
curve'.  However, if <A HREF="mpc3641.html#plot3">straight lines fit
separately to each day's measurements</A> show very disparate responses,
the instrument, at best, will require calibration on a daily basis and,
at worst, may be sufficiently lacking in control to be usable.

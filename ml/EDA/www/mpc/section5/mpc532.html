<I>Purpose of this page</I>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=85%>
The purpose of this page is to outline methods for 
assessing uncertainties related to material inhomogeneities.  
Artifacts, electrical devices, and chemical substances, etc. can be
inhomogeneous relative to the quantity that is being characterized
by the measurement process.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top>
<I>Effect of inhomogeneity on the uncertainty</I>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=85%>
Inhomogeneity can be a factor in the uncertainty analysis where
<OL>
   <LI>an artifact is characterized by a single value and the artifact
       is inhomogeneous over its surface, etc.
   <LI>a lot of items is assigned a single value from a few samples
       from the lot and the lot is inhomogeneous from sample to sample.
</OL>
An unfortunate aspect of this situation is that the uncertainty from
inhomogeneity may dominate the uncertainty.  If the measurement process
itself is very precise and in statistical control, the total uncertainty
may still be unacceptable for practical purposes because of material
inhomogeneities. 
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top>
<I>Targeted measurements can eliminate the effect of inhomogeneity</I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85% VALIGN=TOP>
It may be possible to measure an artifact very carefully at a
specific site and direct the user to also measure at this site.  
In this case there is no contribution to measurement uncertainty 
from inhomogeneity.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top>
<I>Example</I>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=85%>
Silicon wafers are doped with boron to produce desired levels of
resistivity (ohm.cm).  Manufacturing processes for semiconductors are
not yet capable (at least at the time this was originally written) of
producing 2" diameter wafers with constant resistivity over the
surfaces.  However, because measurements made at the center of a wafer
by a certification laboratory can be reproduced in the industrial
setting, the inhomogeneity is not a factor in the uncertainty analysis
 -- as long as only the center-point of the wafer is used for future
measurements. 
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top>
<I>Random inhomogeneities</I>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=85%>
Random inhomogeneities are assessed using statistical methods for
quantifying random errors.  An example of inhomogeneity is a chemical
compound which cannot be sufficiently homogenized with respect to
isotopes of interest. Isotopic ratio determinations, which are
destructive, must be determined from measurements on a few bottles
drawn at random from the lot.  
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top>
<I>Best strategy</I>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=85%>
The best strategy is to draw a sample of bottles from the lot for the
purpose of <A HREF="mpc5321.html">identifying and quantifying
between-bottle variability</A>.  These measurements can be made with
a method that lacks the accuracy required to certify isotopic ratios,
but is precise enough to allow between-bottle comparisons.  A second
sample is drawn from the lot and measured with an accurate method for
determining isotopic ratios, and the reported value for the lot is
taken to be the average of these determinations.   There are therefore
two components of uncertainty assessed:
<OL>
   <LI>component that quantifies the imprecision of the average
   <LI>component that quantifies how much an individual bottle can
       deviate from the average.
</OL>
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top>
<I>Systematic inhomogeneities</I>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=85%>
Systematic inhomogeneities require a somewhat different approach.
Roughness can vary systematically over the surface of a 2" square metal
piece lathed to have a specific roughness profile.  The certification
laboratory can measure the piece at several sites, but unless it is
possible to characterize roughness as a mathematical function of
position on the piece, inhomogeneity must be assessed as a source of
uncertainty.  
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top>
<I>Best  strategy</I>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=85%>
In this situation, the best strategy is to compute the 
reported value as the average of measurements made over the surface of
the piece and assess an uncertainty for departures from the average.
The component of uncertainty can be assessed by one of several
<A HREF="mpc533.html">methods for evaluating bias</A> -- depending on
the type of inhomogeneity.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top>
<I>Standard method</I>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=85%>
<A NAME="stddevinhom">The simplest approach to the computation of
uncertainty for systematic inhomogeneity is to compute the maximum
deviation from the reported value and, assuming a <A HREF="mpc541.html">
uniform, normal or triangular distribution</A> for the distribution of
inhomogeneity, compute the appropriate standard deviation.  Sometimes
the approximate shape of the distribution can be inferred from the
inhomogeneity measurements.  The standard deviation for inhomogeneity
assuming a uniform distribution is:

<I>ISO definition of uncertainty</I>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=85%><!-- Add main text below -->
<A NAME="ISO">Uncertainty, as defined in the ISO Guide to the
Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement
(<A HREF="../section7/mpc7.html#GUM">GUM</A>) and the International
Vocabulary of Basic and General Terms in Metrology
(<A HREF="../section7/mpc7.html#VIM">VIM</A>), is a
<BLOCKQUOTE>
   "parameter, associated with the result of a measurement, that
   characterizes the dispersion of the values that could reasonably
   be attributed to the measurand."

</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top><!-- begin paragraph -->
<I>Consistent with historical view of uncertainty</I>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=85%>
This definition is consistent with the well-established concept that
an uncertainty statement assigns credible limits to the accuracy of a
reported value, stating to what extent that value may differ from its
reference value (<A HREF="../section7/mpc7.html#Eisenhart">Eisenhart</A>).
In some cases, reference values will be traceable to a national
standard, and in certain other cases, reference values will be
consensus values based on measurements made according to a specific
protocol by a group of laboratories.

<TR>
<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top><!-- begin paragraph -->
<I>Accounts for both random error and bias</I>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=85%><!-- Add main text below -->
The estimation of a possible discrepancy takes into account both
random error and bias in the measurement process.  The distinction to
keep in mind with regard to random error and bias is that random
errors cannot be corrected, and biases can, theoretically at least,
be corrected or eliminated from the measurement result. 
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top><!-- begin paragraph -->
<I>Relationship to precision and bias statements</I>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=85%><!-- Add main text below -->
Precision and bias are properties of a measurement <U>method</U>.
Uncertainty is a property of a <I>specific result</I> for a single
test item that depends on a specific measurement configuration
(laboratory/instrument/operator, etc.).  It depends on the
repeatability of the instrument; the reproducibility of the result
over time; the number of measurements in the test result; and all
sources of random and systematic error that could contribute to
disagreement between the result and its reference value.

<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top><!-- begin paragraph -->
<I>Handbook follows the ISO approach</I>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=85%><!-- Add main text below -->
This Handbook follows the ISO approach
(<A HREF="../section7/mpc7.html#GUM">GUM</A>) to stating and combining
components of uncertainty.  To this basic structure, it adds a
statistical framework for estimating individual components, 
particularly those that are classified as <A HREF="mpc53.html">type A 
uncertainties</A>.

<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top><!-- begin paragraph -->
<I>Basic ISO tenets</I>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=85%>
<A NAME="zero">The ISO approach is based on the following rules:
<UL>
   <LI>Each uncertainty component is quantified by a standard deviation.
   <LI>All biases are assumed to be corrected and any uncertainty is
       the uncertainty of the correction.
   <LI>Zero corrections are allowed if the bias cannot be corrected
       and an uncertainty is assessed.
   <LI>All uncertainty intervals are symmetric.
</UL>
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top>
<I>ISO approach to classifying sources of error</I>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=85%><!-- Add main text below -->
Components are grouped into two major categories, depending on the
source of the data and not on the type of error, and each component
is quantified by a standard deviation. The categories are:
<UL>
   <LI>Type A - components evaluated by statistical methods 
   <LI>Type B - components evaluated by other means (or in other
       laboratories) 
</UL>
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top>
<I>Interpretation of this classification</I>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=85%>
One way of interpreting this classification is that it distinguishes
between information that comes from sources local to the measurement
process and information from other sources -- although this
interpretation does not always hold.  In the computation of the final
uncertainty it makes no difference how the components are classified
because the ISO guidelines treat type A and type B evaluations in the
same manner.

</TR>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top>
<I>Rule of quadrature</I>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=85%>
<!-- Add main text below -->
All uncertainty components (standard deviations) are combined by
root-sum-squares (quadrature) to arrive at a 'standard uncertainty',
<i>u</i>, which is the standard deviation of the reported value,
taking into account all sources of error, both random and systematic,
that affect the measurement result.

<I>Expanded uncertainty for a high degree of confidence</I>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=85%><!-- Add main text below -->
If the purpose of the uncertainty statement is to provide coverage
with a high level of confidence, an expanded uncertainty is computed as

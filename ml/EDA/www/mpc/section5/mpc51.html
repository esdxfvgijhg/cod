<I>Issues for uncertainty analysis</I>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=85%>
Evaluation of uncertainty is an ongoing process that can consume time
and resources.  It can also require the services of someone who is
familiar with data analysis techniques, particularly statistical
analysis.  Therefore, it is important for laboratory personnel who are
approaching  uncertainty analysis for the first time to be aware of the
resources required and to carefully lay out a plan for data collection
and analysis.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top>
<I>Problem areas</I>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=85%>
Some laboratories, such as test laboratories, may not have the
resources to undertake detailed uncertainty analyses even though,
increasingly, quality management standards such as the ISO 9000 series
are requiring that all measurement results be accompanied by statements
of uncertainty.
<P>
Other situations where uncertainty analyses are problematical are:
<UL>
   <LI>One-of-a-kind measurements
   <LI>Dynamic measurements that depend strongly on the application
       for the measurement
</UL>
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top>
<I>Directions being pursued</I>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=85%>
What can be done in these situations?  There is no definitive answer
at this time.  Several organizations, such as the National Conference
of Standards Laboratories <A HREF="../section7/mpc7.html#NCSL">(NCSL)</A>
and the International Standards Organization
<A HREF="../section7/mpc7.html#ISO">(ISO)</A> are investigating methods
for dealing with this problem, and there is a document in draft that
will recommend a simplified approach to uncertainty analysis based on
results of interlaboratory tests.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top>
<I>Relationship to interlaboratory test results</I>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=85%>
Many laboratories or industries participate in interlaboratory
studies where the test method itself is evaluated for:
<UL>
   <LI>repeatability within laboratories
   <LI>reproducibility across laboratories
</UL>
These evaluations do not lead to uncertainty statements because the
purpose of the interlaboratory test is to evaluate, and then improve,
the test method as it is applied across the industry.  The purpose of
uncertainty analysis is to evaluate the result of a particular
measurement, in a particular laboratory, at a particular time.
However, the two purposes are related.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top>
<I>Default recommendation for test laboratories</I>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=85%>
If a test laboratory has been party to an interlaboratory test that
follows the recommendations and analyses of an American Society for
Testing Materials standard <A HREF="../section7/mpc7.html#ASTME691">
(ASTM E691)</A> or an ISO standard
<A HREF="../section7/mpc7.html#ISO5725">(ISO 5725)</A>, the laboratory
can, as a default, represent its standard uncertainty for a single
measurement as the reproducibility standard deviation as defined in
ASTM E691 and ISO 5725.  This standard deviation includes components
for within-laboratory repeatability common to all laboratories and
between-laboratory variation.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top>
<I>Drawbacks of this procedure</I>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=85%>
The standard deviation computed in this manner describes a future
single measurement made at a laboratory randomly drawn from the group
and leads to a prediction interval
<A HREF="../section7/mpc7.html#Hahn"> (Hahn & Meeker)</A> rather than a
confidence interval.  It is not an ideal solution and may produce
either an unrealistically small or unacceptably large uncertainty for
a particular laboratory.  The procedure can reward laboratories with
poor performance or those that do not follow the test procedures to the
letter and punish laboratories with good performance.  Further, the
procedure does not take into account sources of uncertainty other than
those captured in the interlaboratory test.  Because the interlaboratory
test is a snapshot at one point in time, characteristics of the
measurement process over time cannot be accurately evaluated.
Therefore, it is a strategy to be used only where there is no
possibility of conducting a realistic uncertainty investigation.

Type A sources of uncertainty fall into three main
categories: 
<OL>
   <LI><A HREF="mpc5311.html">Uncertainties that reveal themselves over
       time</A> 
   <LI><A HREF="mpc5312.html">Uncertainties caused by specific conditions
       of measurement</A> 
   <LI><A HREF="mpc532.html">Uncertainties caused by material
       inhomogeneities</A>
</OL> 
</TD>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN="top">
<I>Time-dependent changes are a primary source of random errors</I>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=85% VALIGN=TOP>
One of the most important indicators of random error is time, with the
root cause perhaps being environmental changes over time.
<A HREF="mpc5311.html">Three levels of time-dependent effects</A> are
discussed in this section.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN="top">
<I>Many possible configurations may exist in a laboratory
for making measurements</I>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=85%>
Other sources of uncertainty are related to measurement
configurations within the laboratory. Measurements on test items
are usually made on a single day, with a single operator, on a
single instrument, etc. If the intent of the uncertainty is to
characterize all measurements made in the laboratory, the
uncertainty should account for any differences due to: 
<OL>
   <LI>instruments 
   <LI>operators 
   <LI>geometries 
   <LI>other 
</OL>
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN="top">
<I>Examples of causes of differences within a laboratory</I>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=85%> 
Examples of causes of differences within a well-maintained
laboratory are: 
<OL>
   <LI>Differences among instruments for measurements of derived units,
       such as sheet resistance of silicon, where the instruments
       cannot be directly calibrated to a reference base 
   <LI>Differences among operators for optical measurements that are
       not automated and depend strongly on operator sightings 
   <LI>Differences among geometrical or electrical configurations of
       the instrumentation
</OL> 
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN="top">
<I>Calibrated instruments do not fall in this class</I>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=85%>  
Calibrated instruments do not normally fall in this class because
uncertainties associated with the instrument's calibration are
reported as type B evaluations, and the instruments in the laboratory
should agree within the calibration uncertainties.  Instruments whose
responses are not directly calibrated to the defined unit are
candidates for type A evaluations.  This covers situations in which
the measurement is defined by a test procedure or standard practice
using a specific instrument type. 
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN="top">
<I>Evaluation  depends on the context for the uncertainty</I>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=85%> 
How these differences are treated depends primarily on the context for
the uncertainty statement.  The differences, depending on the context,
will be treated either as <A HREF="mpc5312.html">random differences</A>,
or as <A HREF="mpc533.html">bias differences</A>.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN="top">
<I>Uncertainties due to inhomogeneities</I>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=85%>
Artifacts, electrical devices, and chemical substances, etc. can be
inhomogeneous relative to the quantity that is being characterized
by the measurement process. If this fact is known beforehand, it
may be possible to measure the artifact very carefully at a
specific site and then direct the user to also measure at this site.
In this case, there is no contribution to measurement uncertainty
from inhomogeneity. 
<P>
However, this is not always possible, and measurements may be
destructive.  As an example, compositions of chemical compounds may
vary from bottle to bottle.  If the reported value for the lot is
established from measurements on a few bottles drawn at random from
the lot, this variability must be taken into account in the uncertainty
statement. 
<P>
Methods for testing for <A HREF="mpc532.html">inhomogeneity</A> and
assessing the appropriate uncertainty are discussed on another page.

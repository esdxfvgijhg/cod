NOTE: This feature is currently disabled.
<p>
Before Dataplot can be run from the Handbook, both the web server
and the web browser must be configured to run Dataplot.
We provide the configuration information for several of the
most common platforms and browsers.  For other platforms and
browsers, it should be possible to do something similar.

   <li>Configuring the <A href="dpbrows.html#2000">Netscape 4.x, 6.x,

   <li>Configuring the <A href="dpbrows.html#Firefox">Firefox
       1.0</A> browser under Windows 2000/XP
</ol>
The linkage to the Dataplot program is currently working for Unix
platforms and for Windows 95/98/ME/NT/2000/XP.  The command line
version is running under Mac OSX (as a Unix/X11 application rather
than a native mode application).  There are no plans to provide a
version of Dataplot for the "classic" Mac operating system.
<P>
We recommend that you test the Dataplot GUI running independently
of the handbook before testing it with the handbook.

<!-- Add main text below -->
If you are accessing the handbook from the NIST server,
you do not need to do anything to the web server as NIST has already
done this (you still need to configure your browser).  If you have
downloaded the handbook and installed it on your local machine, then
you need to configure your web server to recognize the Dataplot
application type.
<P>
Specifically, you need to define a mime type for "dp" extensions.
The Dataplot macros in the handbook are activated by accessing files
that have a "dp" extension.
<p>
The specifics of how to do this vary depending on what web server
software your site runs.  However, the general idea is the same.
For example, if you have a local machine running the Apache web
server, go to the directory (the directory name may vary on your
system):
<ul>
   /local/httpd/conf
</ul>
and edit the file
<ul>
   mime.types
</ul>
by adding the line
<ul>
  application/x-dataplot&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dp
</ul>
For other web servers, a similar file will need to have this line
added.  
<p>
This step will typically need to be performed by your local
system administrator who should be knowledgeable in setting up
new application types for the server.

For version 4 of the Netscape browser under Unix platforms,

       <p>
       Then click OK to activate the type.
</ol>
The line above assumes you have installed the Dataplot GUI in the
default directory.  If you have used a different directory,
then modify "/usr/local/bin" to reflect the correct location.
The "-right" option brings up the Dataplot windows so they are
right justified on your screen.  You can change "-right" to either
"-left" or "-center" to left justify or center justify respectively.
This is simply a matter of taste.

Note: For Windows platforms, Dataplot was upgraded 11/2002 to use

If you have the Install Shield installation, replace

A slightly different procedure can be used under Windows 2000
or Windows XP for Netscape.  For Windows 2000 or Windows XP, you
can do the following:
<ol>
   <li>If you tried to create a definition using the Tools menu
       of Windows Explorer, delete this first.
   <li>Go to one of the case studies and select the "Work This
       Example Yourself" entry.  From there, initiate the
       first Dataplot macro (i.e., the link in the left-hand
       column of the table).
   <li>This should bring up the "File Download" menu.  Do the
       following with this menu:
       <ol>
          <li>Uncheck the "Always ask before opening" option.
          <li>Click "Open"
       </ol>
   <li>This should bring up the "Open With" menu.  Do the following
       with this menu:
       <ol>
          <li>Click on the file browser (i.e., the "...") and go
              to the directory "C:\Program Files\NIST\DATAPLOT".
              If you have an older Dataplot installation that
              installed Dataplot in C:\DATAPLOT, go to that
              directory instead.  Select the file "DP.BAT" from the
              Dataplot directory.
          <li>Check the "Always use this program to open files of
              this type" button.
          <li>Click OK.
       </ol>
   <li>When you click on the next Dataplot macro, it should run
       Dataplot without bringing up any Windows menus.  If you
       do get the "Open With" menu, uncheck the "Always ask before
       opening" button and then click OK.
</ol>
The above assumes you have installed Dataplot in the default
directory.  If you have used a different directory, then modify
"C:\Program Files\NIST\DATAPLOT" or "C:\DATAPLOT\DP.BAT" to reflect
the correct location.
<P>
The file DP.BAT is a batch file that comes with the Dataplot

Use the following procedure to configure the Firefox browser under

   <li>Initiate one of the Dataplot macros in the

   <li>You should see a dialog appear prompting you for

   <li>Use the file browser to navigate to the folder where you

       typically be
       <br>
       "C:\Program Files\NIST\DATAPLOT" or
       "C:\DATAPLOT").
   <li>Firefox does not list ".BAT" files, so you need to manually
       type in DP.BAT for the application.
   <li>The next time you initiate a Dataplot macro, you may be
       prompted as to whether you want to "Open" or "Save" the
       file.  Check the "Do this automatically for files like this
       from now on" box.  Subsequent Dataplot macros should then
       run automatically.
</ol>
If you want to remove the ".DP" file type, select "Tools" from
the Firefox menus.  Then select Options and then select
Downloads.  At this point you will see the menu that allows you
to delete the "DP" file type.

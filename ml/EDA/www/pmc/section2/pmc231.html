<!-- Add main text below -->
Sampling plans are typically set up with reference to an acceptable
quality level, or <a href="pmc22.html#Acceptable Quality Level">AQL</a>.  
The AQL is the base line requirement for the quality of the
producer's product. The producer would like to design a sampling plan
such that the <a href="pmc22.html#Operating Characteristic (OC)">OC
curve</a> yields a high probability of acceptance at the AQL. On
the other side of the OC curve, the consumer wishes to be protected from
accepting poor quality from the producer.  So the consumer establishes a
criterion, the<i> lot tolerance percent defective</i> or
<a href="pmc22.html#Lot Tolerance Percent Defective">LTPD</a>.
<!-- <a href="pmc21.htm#Lot Tolerance Percent Defective">.</a> -->
Here the idea
is to only accept poor quality product with a very low probability.
Mil. Std. plans have been used for over 50 years to achieve these goals.

Military Standard 105E sampling plan

<!-- Add main text below -->
Standard military sampling procedures for inspection by attributes were
developed during World War II. Army Ordnance tables and procedures were
generated in the early 1940's and these grew into the Army Service Forces
tables. At the end of the war, the Navy also worked on a set of tables.
In the meanwhile, the Statistical Research Group at Columbia University
performed research and outputted many outstanding results on attribute
sampling plans.
<p>
These three streams combined in 1950 into a standard called Mil.
Std. 105A.  It has since been modified from time to time and issued
as 105B, 105C and 105D.  Mil. Std. 105D was issued by the U.S. government
in 1963.  It was adopted in 1971 by the American National Standards
Institute as ANSI Standard Z1.4 and in 1974 it was adopted (with minor
changes) by the International Organization for Standardization as
ISO Std.  2859.  The latest revision is Mil. Std 105E and was issued
in 1989.
<p>
These three similar standards are continuously being updated and revised,
but the basic tables remain the same.  Thus the discussion that follows
of the germane aspects of Mil. Std. 105E also applies to the other two
standards.

<!-- Add main text below -->
This document is essentially a set of individual plans, organized in
a system of sampling schemes.  A sampling scheme consists of a
combination of a normal sampling plan, a tightened sampling plan, and
a reduced sampling plan plus rules for switching from one to the other.

AQL is foundation of standard

<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=85%>
<!-- Add main text below -->
The foundation of the Standard is the acceptable quality level or
AQL.  In the following scenario, a certain military agency,
called the Consumer from here on, wants to purchase a particular product
from a supplier, called the Producer from here on.
<p>
In applying the Mil. Std. 105D it is expected that there is perfect
agreement between Producer and Consumer regarding what the AQL is
for a given product characteristic.  It is understood by both parties
that the Producer will be submitting for inspection a number of lots
whose quality level is typically as good as specified by the Consumer.
Continued quality is assured by the acceptance or rejection of lots
following a particular sampling plan and also by providing for a shift
to another, tighter sampling plan, when there is evidence that the
Producer's product does not meet the agreed-upon AQL.

Standard offers 3 types of sampling plans

<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=85%>
<!-- Add main text below -->
Mil. Std. 105E offers three types of sampling plans: single, double
and multiple plans. The choice is, in general, up to the inspectors.
<p>
Because of the three possible selections, the standard does not give
a sample size, but rather a sample code letter. This, together with the
decision of the type of plan yields the specific sampling plan to be
used.

Inspection level

<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=85%>
<!-- Add main text below -->
In addition to an initial decision on an AQL it is also necessary
to decide on an "inspection level".  This determines the relationship
between the lot size and the sample size. The standard offers three
general and four special levels.

The steps in the use of the standard can be summarized as follows:
<ol>
   <li>Decide on the AQL.
   <li>Decide on the inspection level.
   <li>Determine the lot size.
   <li>Enter the table to find sample size code letter.
   <li>Decide on type of sampling to be used.
   <li>Enter proper table to find the plan to be used.
   <li>Begin with normal inspection, follow the switching rules
       and the rule for stopping the inspection (if needed).
</ol>

<!-- Add main text below -->
Acceptance sampling is an important field of statistical
quality control that was popularized by Dodge and Romig and originally
applied by the U.S. military to the testing of bullets during World War
II.  If every bullet was tested in advance, no bullets would be left to
ship. If, on the other hand, none were tested, malfunctions might
occur in the field of battle, with potentially disastrous results.

Definintion of Lot Acceptance Sampling
</I>
</TD>
<TD WIDTH=85% VALIGN=TOP>
<!-- Add main text below -->
Dodge reasoned that a sample should be picked at random from the lot,
and on the basis of information that was yielded by the sample, a
decision should be made regarding the disposition of the lot. In
general, the decision is either to accept or reject the lot. This
process is called <i>Lot Acceptance Sampling </i>or just <i>Acceptance
Sampling</i>.

<!-- Add main text below -->
Acceptance sampling is "the middle of the road" approach between no
inspection and 100% inspection. There are two major classifications of
acceptance plans: by <i>attributes</i> ("go, no-go") and by
<i>variables</i>.  The attribute case is the most common for acceptance
sampling, and will be assumed for the rest of this section.

A point to remember is that the main purpose of acceptance
sampling is to decide whether or not the lot is likely to be acceptable,
not to estimate the quality of the lot.

Acceptance sampling is employed when one or several of
the following hold:&nbsp;
<ul>
   <li>Testing is destructive</li>
   <li>The cost of 100% inspection is very high</li>
   <li>100% inspection takes too long</li>
</ul>

<i>Acceptance Quality Control and Acceptance Sampling</i>
</td>

<td WIDTH="85%" VALIGN=TOP>
It was pointed out by Harold Dodge in 1969 that Acceptance Quality
Control is not the same as Acceptance Sampling. The latter depends on
specific sampling plans, which when implemented indicate the conditions
for acceptance or rejection of the immediate lot that is being inspected.
The former may be implemented in the form of an Acceptance Control Chart.
The control limits for the Acceptance Control Chart are computed using
the specification limits and the standard deviation of what is being
monitored (see
<a href="../section7/pmc7.html#Ryan,">Ryan, 2000</a> for details).

<i>An observation by Harold Dodge</i>
</td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="85%">
In 1942, Dodge stated:
<p>
"....basically the "acceptance quality control" system that was developed
encompasses the concept of protecting the consumer from getting unacceptable
defective product, and encouraging the producer in the use of process quality
control by: varying the quantity and severity of acceptance inspections
in direct relation to the importance of the characteristics inspected,
and in the inverse relation to the goodness of the quality level as indication
by those inspections."
<p>
To reiterate the difference in these two approaches: acceptance sampling
plans are one-shot deals, which essentially test short-run effects. Quality
control is of the long-run variety, and is part of a well-designed system
for lot acceptance.
</td>

<tr>
<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="15%">
<i>An observation by Ed Schilling</i>
</td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="85%">
Schilling (1989) said:
<p>
"An individual sampling plan has much the effect of a lone sniper,
while the sampling plan scheme can provide a fusillade in the battle for
quality improvement."
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="15%">
<i>Control of product quality using acceptance control charts</i>
</td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="85%">
According to the ISO standard on acceptance
control charts <a href="../section7/pmc7.html">(ISO 7966, 1993)</a>, an
acceptance control chart combines consideration of control implications
with elements of acceptance sampling. It is an appropriate tool for helping
to make decisions with respect to process acceptance. The difference between
acceptance sampling approaches and acceptance control charts is the emphasis
on process acceptability rather than on product disposition decisions.

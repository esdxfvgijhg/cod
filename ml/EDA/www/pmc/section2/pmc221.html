<td WIDTH="85%"><!-- Add main text below -->Sampling plans are typically
set up with reference to an acceptable quality level, or
<a href="pmc21.html#Acceptable Quality Level">AQL</a>.
The AQL is the base line requirement for the quality of the producer's
product. The producer would like to design a sampling plan such that the
<a href="pmc21.html#Operating Characteristic (OC)">OC
curve</a> yields a high probability of acceptance at the AQL. On the other
side of the OC curve, the consumer wishes to be protected from accepting
poor quality from the producer. So the consumer establishes a criterion,
the<i> lot tolerance percent defective</i> or <a href="pmc21.html#Lot Tolerance Percent Defective">LTPD.</a>&nbsp;
Here the idea is to only accept poor quality product with a very low probability.
Mil Std plans have been used for over 50 years to achieve these goals.
<p><b>The U.S. Department of Defense Military Standard 105D</b>
<p>Standard military sampling procedures for inspection by attributes were
developed during World War II. Army Ordnance tables and procedures were
generated in the early 1940's and these grew into the Army Service Forces
tables. At the end of the war, the Navy also worked on a set of tables.
In the meanwhile, the Statistical Research Group at Columbia University
performed research and outputted many outstanding results on attribute
sampling plans.
<p>These three streams combined in 1950 into a&nbsp; standard called Mil.
Std. 105A.&nbsp; It has since been modified from time to time and issued
as 105B, 195C and 105D. Mil. Std. 105D was issued by the U.S. government
in 1963.&nbsp; It was adopted in 1971 by the American National Standards
Institute as ANSI Standard Z1.4 and in 1974 it was adopted (with minor
changes) by the International Organization for Standardization as ISO Std.
2859.&nbsp;
<p>These three similar standards are continuously being updated and revised,
but the basic tables remain the same.&nbsp; Thus the discussion that follows
of the germane aspects of Mil.Std. 105D also applies to the other two standards.&nbsp;
<p><b>Description of Mil. Std. 105D</b>
<p>This document is essentially a set of individual plans, organized in
a system of sampling schemes. A sampling scheme consists of a combination
of a normal sampling plan, a tightened sampling plan, and a reduced sampling
plan plus rules for switching from one to the other.
<p>The foundation of the Standard is the acceptable quality level or AQL.
In the following scenario&nbsp; a certain military agency, called the Consumer
from here on, wants to purchase a particular product from a supplier, called
the Producer from here on.&nbsp;
<p>In applying the Mil. Std. 105D it is expected that there is perfect
agreement between Producer and Consumer regarding what the AQL is for a
given product characteristic. It is understood by both parties that the
Producer will be submitting for inspection a number of&nbsp; lots whose
quality level is typically as good as specified by the Consumer. Continued
quality is assured by the acceptance or rejection of lots following a particular
sampling plan and also by providing for a shift to another, tighter sampling
plan, when there is evidence that the Producer's product does not meet
the agreed upon AQL.&nbsp;
<p>Mil. Std. 105D offers three types of sampling plans, single, double
and multiple plans. The choice is, in general, up to the inspectors.&nbsp;
<br>Because of the three possible selections, the standard does not give
a sample size, but rather a sample code letter. This, together with the
decision of the type of plan yields the specific sampling plan to be used.&nbsp;
<p>In addition to an initial decision on an AQL it is also necessary to
decide on an "inspection level". This determines the relationship between
the lot size and the sample size. The standard offers three general and
four special levels.&nbsp;
<p>The steps in the use of the standard can be summarized as follows:&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1&nbsp;&nbsp; Decide on the AQL.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp; Decide on the inspection level.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.&nbsp; Determine lot size.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.&nbsp; Enter table to find sample size code
letter.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.&nbsp; Decide on type of sampling to be
used.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.&nbsp; Enter proper table to find the plan
to be used.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.&nbsp; Begin with normal inspection , follow
the switching rules
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the rule
for stopping the inspection (if needed).&nbsp;

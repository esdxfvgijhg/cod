A lot acceptance sampling plan (LASP) is a sampling scheme
and a set of rules for making decisions. The decision, based on counting
the number of defectives in a sample, can be to accept the lot, reject
the lot, or even, for multiple or sequential sampling schemes, to take
another sample and then repeat the decision process.

LASPs fall into the following categories:
<ul>
  <li><a NAME="Single sampling"><b>Single sampling plans:</b></a> One
      sample of items is selected at random from a lot and the
      disposition of the lot is determined from the resulting
      information. These plans are usually denoted as (\(n,c\)) 
      <!-- (<i>n,c</i>) -->
      plans for a sample size \(n\),
      <!-- <i> n,</i> -->
      where the lot is rejected if there are more than \(c\)
      <!-- <i>c</i> -->
      defectives. <i>These are the most
      common (and easiest) plans to use although not the most efficient
      in terms of average number of samples needed.</i>
      </li>
      <p>
  <li><b>Double sampling plans:</b> After the first sample is tested,
      there are three possibilities:
      <ol>
         <li>Accept the lot</li>
         <li>Reject the lot</li>
         <li>No decision</li>
      </ol>
      If the outcome is (3), and a second sample is taken, the procedure
      is to combine the results of both samples and make a final
      decision based on that information.
      </li>
      <p>
  <li><a NAME="Multiple sampling"><b>Multiple sampling plans: </b></a>
      This is an extension of the double sampling plans where more than
      two samples are needed to reach a conclusion.  The advantage of
      multiple sampling is smaller sample sizes.
      </li>
      <p>
  <li><a NAME="Sequential sampling"><b>Sequential sampling plans:</b>
      </a> This is the ultimate extension of multiple sampling where
      items are selected from a lot one at a time and after inspection
      of each item a decision is made to accept or reject the lot or
      select another unit.
      </li>
      <p>
  <li><a NAME="Skip lot sampling"><b>Skip lot sampling plans:</b></a>
      Skip lot sampling means that only a fraction of the submitted lots
      are inspected.

Deriving a plan, within one of the categories listed above, is discussed
in the pages that follow.  All derivations depend on the properties you
want the plan to have. These are described using the following terms:
<ul>
  <li><a NAME="Acceptable Quality Level"></a><b><i>Acceptable Quality
      Level</i> (AQL)</b>: The AQL is a percent defective that is the
      base line requirement for the quality of the producer's product.
      The producer would like to design a sampling plan such that there
      is a <i>high probability of accepting</i> a lot that has a defect
      level less than or equal to the AQL.</li>
      <p>
  <li><a NAME="Lot Tolerance Percent Defective"></a><b><i>Lot Tolerance
      Percent Defective</i> (LTPD)</b>: The LTPD is a designated high
      defect level that would be unacceptable to the consumer.  The
      consumer would like the sampling plan to have a<i> low probability
      of accepting</i> a lot with a defect level as high as the
      LTPD.</li>
      <p>
  <li><a NAME="Type I Error (Producers"></a><b><i>Type I Error
      (Producer's Risk)</i></b>: This is the probability, for a given
      (\(n,c\))
      <!-- (<i>n,c</i>) -->
      sampling plan, of rejecting a lot that has a defect
      level equal to the AQL. The producer suffers when this occurs,
      because a lot with acceptable quality was rejected. The symbol \(\alpha\)
      <!-- <img align=absmiddle src="eqns/alpha.gif" alt="alpha"> -->
      is commonly used for the Type I error and typical values for \(\alpha\)
      <!-- <img align=absmiddle src="eqns/alpha.gif" alt="alpha"> -->
      range from 0.2 to 0.01.</li>
      <p>
  <li><a NAME="Type II Error (Consumers"></a><b><i>Type II Error
      (Consumer's Risk): </i></b>This is the probability, for a given
      (\(n,c\))
      <!-- (<i>n,c</i>) -->
      sampling plan, of accepting a lot with a defect level
      equal to the LTPD. The consumer suffers when this occurs, because
      a lot with unacceptable quality was accepted.  The symbol \(\beta\)
      <!-- <img align=absmiddle src="eqns/beta.gif" alt="beta"> -->
      is commonly used for the Type II error and typical values range
      from 0.2 to 0.01.</li>
      <p>
  <li><a NAME="Operating Characteristic (OC)"></a><b><i>Operating
      Characteristic</i> (OC) <i>Curve: </i></b>This curve plots the
      probability of accepting the lot (Y-axis) versus the lot fraction
      or percent defectives (X-axis). <i>The OC curve is the primary
      tool for displaying and investigating the properties
      of a LASP</i>.</li>
      <p>
  <li><a NAME="Average Outgoing Quality"></a><b><i>Average Outgoing
      Quality</i> (AOQ): </b>A common procedure, when sampling and
      testing is non-destructive, is to 100 % inspect rejected lots and
      replace all defectives with good units.  In this case, all rejected
      lots are made perfect and the only defects left are those in lots
      that were accepted. AOQs
      <!-- <i>AOQ</i>'s -->
      refer to the long term defect
      level for this combined LASP and 100 % inspection of rejected lots
      process.  If all lots come in with a defect level of exactly \(p\),
      <!-- <i>p</i>, -->
      and the OC curve for the chosen (\(n,c\))
      <!-- (<i>n,c</i>) -->
      LASP indicates a probability \(p_a\)
      <!-- <i>p<sub>a</sub></i> -->
      of accepting such a lot, over the long run the AOQ
      <!-- <i>AOQ</i> -->
      can easily be shown to be:

$$ \mbox{AOQ} = \frac{p_a  p (N - n)}{N} \, ,$$

             ALT="AOQ = p(a)*p*(N-n)/N">
      </ul>
      <p>
-->
      where \(N\)
      <!-- <i>N</i> -->
      is the lot size.
      <p>
  <li><a NAME="Average Outgoing Quality Level"></a><b><i>Average
      Outgoing Quality Level</i> (AOQL): </b>A plot of the AOQ
      <!-- <i>AOQ</i> -->
      (Y-axis) versus the incoming lot \(p\)
      <!-- <i>p</i> -->
      (X-axis) will start at 0 for \(p=0\),
      <!-- <i>p</i> = 0, -->
      and return to 0 for \(p = 1\)
      <!-- <i>p</i> = 1 -->
      (where every lot is 100 % inspected and rectified).  In between, it will rise
      to a maximum.  This maximum, which is the worst possible long term
      AOQ,
      <!-- <i>AOQ</i>, -->
      is called the AOQL.
      <!-- <i>AOQL</i>. -->
  </li> 
      <p>
  <li><a NAME="Average Total Inspection"></a><b><i>Average Total
      Inspection</i> (ATI): </b>When rejected lots are 100 % inspected,
      it is easy to calculate the ATI
      <!-- <i>ATI</i> -->
      if lots come consistently
      with a defect level of \(p\).
      <!-- <i>p</i>. -->
      For a LASP (\(n,c\))
      <!-- (<i>n,c</i>) -->
      with a probability \(p_a\)
      <!-- <i>p<sub>a</sub></i> -->
      of accepting a lot with defect level \(p\),
      <!-- <i> p</i>, -->
      we have

$$ \mbox{ATI} = n + (1-p_a)(N-n) \, , $$
<!--
      <p>
      <ul>
         <i>ATI</i> =<i> n + (</i>1 <i>- p<sub>a</sub>) (N - n)</i>
      </ul>
      <p>
-->
      where \(N\)
      <!-- <i>N</i>  -->
      is the lot size.
      <p>
  <li><a NAME="Average Sample Number"></a><b><i>Average Sample Number</i>
      (ASN): </b>For a single sampling LASP (\(n,c\))
      <!-- (<i>n,c</i>) -->
      we know each and every lot has a sample of size \(n\)
      <!--<i>n</i> 
      taken and inspected or tested.  For double, multiple and sequential LASPs,
      the amount of sampling varies depending on the number of
      defects observed. For any given double, multiple or sequential
      plan, a long term \(ASN\)
      <!-- <i>ASN</i> -->
      can be calculated assuming all lots come in with a defect level of \(p\).
      <!-- <i>p</i>. -->
      A plot of the ASN,
      <!-- <i>ASN</i>, -->
      versus the incoming defect level \(p\),
      <!-- <i>p</i>, -->
      describes the sampling efficiency of a given LASP scheme.</li>

Making a final choice between single or multiple sampling plans that have
acceptable properties is a matter of deciding whether the average
sampling savings gained by the various multiple sampling plans justifies
the additional complexity of these plans and the uncertainty of not
knowing how much sampling and inspection will be done on a day-by-day
basis.

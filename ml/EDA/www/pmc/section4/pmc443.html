<td WIDTH="85%"><!-- Add main text below -->
Many time series display seasonality.
By seasonality, we mean periodic fluctuations.  For example, retail
sales tend to peak for the Christmas season and then decline after
the holidays.  So time series of retail sales will typically show
increasing sales from September through December and declining sales
in January and February.
<p>
Seasonality is quite common in economic time series.  It is less
common in engineering and scientific data.
<p>
If seasonality is present, it must be incorporated into the time
series model. In this section, we discuss techniques for detecting
seasonality.  We defer modeling of seasonality until later sections.

he following graphical techniques can be used to detect seasonality.
<ol>
   <li>A <a href="../../eda/section3/runseqpl.html">run sequence
       plot</a> will often show seasonality.</li>
       <p>
    <li>A <a href="pmc4431.html">seasonal subseries plot</a> is a
       specialized technique for showing seasonality.</li>
       <p>
   <li>Multiple <a href="../../eda/section3/boxplot.html">box
       plots</a> can be used as an alternative to the seasonal
       subseries plot to detect seasonality.</li>
       <p>
   <li>The <a href="../../eda/section3/autocopl.html">autocorrelation
       plot</a> can help identify seasonality.</li>
</ol>
Examples of each of these plots will be shown below.
<p>
The run sequence plot is a recommended first step for analyzing any
time series.  Although seasonality can sometimes be indicated with
this plot, seasonality is shown more clearly by the seasonal
subseries plot or the box plot.  The seasonal subseries plot does an
excellent job of showing both the seasonal differences (between
group patterns) and also the within-group patterns.  The box plot
shows the seasonal difference (between group patterns) quite well,
but it does not show within group patterns.  However, for large
data sets, the box plot is usually easier to read than the seasonal
subseries plot.
<p>
Both the seasonal subseries plot and the box plot assume that the
seasonal periods are known.  In most cases, the analyst will in fact
know this.  For example, for monthly data, the period is 12 since
there are 12 months in a year.  However, if the period is not known,
the autocorrelation plot can help.  If there is significant
seasonality, the autocorrelation plot should show spikes at lags
equal to the period.  For example, for monthly data, if there is a
seasonality effect, we would expect to see significant peaks
at lag 12, 24, 36, and so on (although the intensity may decrease
the further out we go).

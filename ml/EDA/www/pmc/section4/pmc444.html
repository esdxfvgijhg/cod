<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="85%"><!-- Add main text below -->
One approach is to decompose the time series into a trend, seasonal,
and residual component.
<p>
<a href="pmc435.html">Triple exponential smoothing</a> is an example
of this approach.  Another example, called seasonal <i>loess,</i>
is based on <a href="../../pmd/section1/pmd144.html">locally
weighted least squares</a> and is discussed by
<a href="../../eda/section4/eda43.html#Cleveland2">Cleveland
(1993)</a>.  We do not discuss seasonal <i>loess</i> in this

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="85%"><!-- Add main text below -->
Another approach, commonly used in scientific and engineering
applications, is to analyze the series in the frequency domain.
An example of this approach in modeling a sinusoidal
type data set is shown in the
<a href="../../eda/section4/eda425.html">beam deflection case
study</a>.  The <a href="../../eda/section3/spectrum.html">spectral
plot</a> is the primary tool for the frequency analysis of time
series.
<p>
Detailed discussions of frequency-based methods are included in
<a href="../../eda/section4/eda43.html#Bloomfield">Bloomfield
(1976)</a>,

<a NAME="AR"></a><i>Autoregressive (AR) Models</i>
</td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="85%"><!-- Add main text below -->
A common approach for modeling univariate time series is the
autoregressive (AR) model:

$$ X_t = \delta + \phi_1 X_{t-1} + \phi_2 X_{t-2} + \cdots + \phi_p X_{t-1} + A_t \, $$

<!--
<ul>
   <img SRC="eqns/armodel.gif"
        ALT="X(t) = delta + phi1*X*(t-1) + phi2*X(t-2) + ... +
 phip*X(t-p) + A(t)">
</ul>
-->
where \(X_t\)
<!-- <b><i>X<sub>t</sub></i></b> -->
is the time series, \(A_t\)
<!-- <b><i>A<sub>t</sub></i></b> -->
is white noise, and 

$$ \delta = \left( 1 - \sum_{i=1}^p \phi_i \right) \mu \, , $$

<!-- <img SRC="eqns/phi1.gif" align=ABSCENTER alt="phi1">, ...,
<img SRC="eqns/phip.gif" align=ABSCENTER alt="phip"> and -->
<!--
<ul>
<img SRC="eqns/armean.gif"
     ALT="delta = (1 - SUM[i=1 to p][phi(i)])*mu">
</ul>
-->
with \(\mu\)
<!-- <img align=absmiddle src="eqns/mu.gif" alt="mu"> -->
denoting the process mean.
<p>
An autoregressive model is simply a
<a href="../../pmd/section1/pmd141.html">linear regression</a> 
of the current value of the series against one or more prior
values of the series.  The value of \(p\)
<!-- <b><i>p</i></b> -->
is called the order of the AR model.
<p>
AR models can be analyzed with one of various methods, including
<a href="../../pmd/section4/pmd4.html">standard linear least squares techniques</a>.  
They also have a straightforward interpretation.

<i>Moving Average (MA) Models</i>
</a>
</td>

<td VALIGN=TOPWIDTH="85%"><!-- Add main text below -->
Another common approach for modeling univariate time series models
is the moving average (MA) model:

$$ X_t = \mu + A_t - \theta_1 A_{t-1} - \theta_2 A_{t-2} - \cdots - \theta_q A_{t-q} \, $$

<!-- 
<ul>
<img SRC="eqns/mamodel.gif"
     ALT="X(t) = mu + A(t) - theta1*A(t-1) - theta2*A(t-2) - ... - thetaq*A(t-q)">
</ul>
-->
where \(X_t\)
<!-- <b><i>X<sub>t</sub></i></b> -->
is the time series, \(\mu\)
<!-- <img align=absmiddle SRC="eqns/mu.gif" ALT="mu"> -->
is the mean of the series, \(A_{t-i}\)
<!-- <b><i>A<sub>t-i</sub></i></b> -->
are white noise terms, and \(\theta_1, \, \ldots, \, \theta_q\)
<!-- 
<img SRC="eqns/theta.gif" align=ABSMIDDLE ALT="theta"><sub>1</sub>, ... ,
<img SRC="eqns/theta.gif" align=ABSMIDDLE ALT="theta"><sub>q</sub> 
-->
are the parameters of the model.
The value of \(q\)
<!-- <b><i>q</i></b> -->
is called the order of the MA model.
<p>
That is, a moving average model is conceptually a
<a href="../../pmd/section1/pmd141.html">linear regression</a> of
the current value of the series against the white noise or random
shocks of one or more prior values of the series.  The
random shocks at each point are assumed to come from the same
distribution, typically a normal distribution, with location at
zero and constant scale.  The distinction in this model is that these
random shocks are propogated to future values of the time series.
Fitting the MA estimates is more complicated than with AR models
because the error terms are not observable.  This means
that iterative non-linear fitting procedures need to be used in
place of linear least squares.  MA models also have a less obvious
interpretation than AR models.
<p>
<!--
Given the more difficult estimation and interpretation of MA models,
the obvious question is why are they used instead of AR models?
In the standard regression situation, the error terms, or random
shocks, are assumed to be independent.  That is, the random shocks
at the <i>i</i>th observation only affect that <i>i</i>th
observation.  However, in many time series this assumption is not
valid since the random shocks are propogated to future values of
the time series.  Moving average models accommodate the random
shocks in previous values of the time series in estimating the
current value of the time series.
-->
Sometimes the
<a href="../../eda/section3/autocopl.html">ACF</a> and
<a href="pmc4463.html">PACF</a> will suggest that a MA model would be a
better model choice and sometimes both AR and MA terms should be used
in the same model (see
<a href="pmc445.html">Section 6.4.4.5</a>).
<p>
Note, however, that the error terms <i>after</i> the model is fit
should be independent and follow the standard
<a href="../../eda/section2/eda21.html">assumptions
for a univariate process</a>.

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="15%"><!-- Add marginal notes below -->
<i>Box-Jenkins Approach</i>
</td>

<td WIDTH="85%"><!-- Add main text below -->
Box and Jenkins popularized an approach that combines the moving
average and the autoregressive approaches in the book
"<i><a href="../section7/pmc7.html">Time Series Analysis: Forecasting
and Control</a></i>" (Box, Jenkins, and Reinsel, 1994).
<p>
Although both autoregressive and moving average approaches were
already known (and were originally investigated by Yule), the
contribution of Box and Jenkins was in developing a systematic
methodology for identifying and estimating models that could
incorporate both approaches.  This makes Box-Jenkins models a
powerful class of models.  The next several sections
will discuss these models in detail.

What is Course Builder?
</I>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=85%>
Course Builder is software for custom packaging of the
e-Handbook material for teaching specialized courses.  That is,
you can extract selected pages out of the e-Handbook and bundle
them into a single course.  This course takes the form of a
set of HTML pages.
<p>
Course Builder runs as a Perl-based CGI script.

Getting Started

</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=85%>
It is assumed that you have already sucessfully
<a href="install.html">installed</a> the
Course Builder and have activated the appropriate link on
the main Course Builder web page.
<p>
The first step is to click on this Course Builder link.

Three Components
</I>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=85%>
The Course Builder brings up two browsers consisting of three
components:
<ol>
   <li>The upper frame of the first browser contains the action
       buttons.  Specifically,
       <p>
       <ul>
          <li>The first button is "Add Page".  Click this button
              when you want to add a page to the Course Builder
              project.
              <p>
          <li>The second button is "Remove Page".  Click this button
              when you want to remove a page that has previously
              been added.
              <p>
          <li>The third button is "Clear All".  Click this button
              to clear all previously entered pages (i.e., start
              over).
              <p>
          <li>The fourth button is "Next&gt;&gt;".  Click this
              button when you have added all the pages that
              you want.
       </ul>
       <p>
   <li>The lower frame of the first browser initially contains the
       text "No pages selected.".  As pages are added, this browser
       frame maintains a list of the e-Handbook pages currently in
       the Course Builder project.
       <p>
   <li>The second browser starts with the e-Handbook homepage.
</ol>

<I>
Adding Pages
</I>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=85%>
The basic idea in using the Course Builder is as follows:
<ul>
   <li>In the browser containing the e-Handbook pages, navigate
       to the page you want to add to your course.
       <p>
   <li>Once you find the desired page, click the "Add Page"
       button to add that page to your course.
</ul>
Simply repeat this procedure until all desired pages are added.
<p>
The image below shows a typical screen after adding a number of
pages to the course.  You can click on one of the entries in
the lower left frame to go to that page in the e-Handbook.  For
example, if you want to delete one of the added pages, click on
the link for that page and then click on the "Remove Page"
button in the upper frame.

After you have completed adding all desired pages from the

left frame.
<p>
The first browser reverts to a single frame that will look
like the following image.

<I>
Page to Assemble the Course
</I>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=85%>
There are a number of features in this assembly page.
<ul>
   <li>At the top is a course title.  The default title is
       "Engineering Statistics".  You can edit this to a title
       of your choice.
       <p>
   <li>The course Builder will show a table of the pages.  On the
       left will be section that lets you add page numbering and
       on the right is the title for the corresponding page.
       You can edit these page titles if you like.  If you omit
       page numbers, Course Builder will use a a default numbering
       scheme.
       <p>
   <li>Course Builder automatically adds an Introduction and a
       Conclusions page.
       <p>
   <li>You can specify a prefix consisting of 1 to 3 characters
       for the generated HTML pages.  The default prefix is "esh".
       <p>
   <li>If you have entered your own page numbers, you can click
       on the "Sort" button to sort the pages according to your
       own numbering scheme.
       <p>
   <li>After you make any desired edits, click the "Assemble"
       button to initiate the generation of the course.
</ul>

Creation of a tar File or a WinZip File
</I>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=85%>
After you click the "Assemble" button, Course Builder initiates
the creation of the custom course.
<p>
The following image shows the save for a Unix/Linux platform.
The Course Builder automatically generates a tar file.  Tar
files are the standard archive format for Unix/Linux platforms.
For Windows platforms, Course Builder can be configured to generate
a WinZip file instead.
<p>
A file menu is presented which allows you to specify where you
want to save the file.  For the sake of discussion below, we
will assume that we have saved the file to
"/home/heckert/mycourse.tar".

<I>
Extracting the Assembled Course
</I>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=85%>
The next step is to extract the course on your local platform.
We recommend that you extract the files to an empty directory.
In this example, we could do something like
<ul>
   cd /home/heckert<br>
   mkdir mycourse<br>
   mv mycourse.tar  mycourse<br>
   cd mycourse<br>
   tar -xvf  mycourse.tar<br>
</ul>
This will create a number of files of the form "esh*.htm".  In
addition, there may be some "*.gif" files created.
<p>
For Windows platforms, you will typically use WinZip to extract
the file.  Note that WinZip can extract Unix tar files as well
as "*.zip" files (if Course Builder is installed on a Windows
platform, it will typically be configured to create a "*.zip"
file, if it is installed on a Unix/Linux platform it will typically
be configured to create a tar file).  If you have a program
other than WinZip that can extract zip or tar files, then this
program can be used in place of WinZip.

</TR>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top>
<I>
Viewing the Assembled Course
</I>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=85%>
Once you have extracted the files, you can simply use your
browser to point to the desired page.  The default initial
page is "esh0000.htm".  So for the example here, you would
use the following URL:
<ul>
   file:///home/heckert/mycourse/esh0000.htm
</ul>
<p>
The pages in the assembled course will include "Next" and "Back"
buttons on each page for navigation.
<p>
The following image shows the initial page of the assembled course
for our example.

<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top>
<I>
Some Additional Issues
</I>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=85%>
After you have extracted the course, there are a few issues
that need to be addressed.
<ul>
   <li>You need to move the gifs located in the e-Handbook
       directory "cbuild" to the directory containing the
       assembled course ("mycourse" in the example above).
       <p>
   <li>If the selected pages contain links to other e-Handbook
       pages, these links need to be modified.
       <p>
       If the instructor is the only one navigating the pages
       (e.g., to generate paper copies or to teach the course
       in a slideshow like manner), you can safely ignore
       this issue.
       <p>
       On the other hand, if you want students to be able to access
       the course on their own, you need to examine these links.  If
       the link is to a page that is also included in the assembled
       course, then modify the link to the appropriate page in the
       assembled course.  If the linked page is not included in the
       assembled page, then remove it or insert an absolute link to
       the e-Handbook.
</ul>

<TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=top>
<I>
Known Problems
</I>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=85%>
The following is a list of currently known problems with
the Course Builder.
<ul>
   <li>In some cases, not all gif files are properly extracted.
       For now, these problems have to be fixed manually.
</ul>
We will try to address these problems in future releases of
the Course Builder script.
<p>
If you discover additional bugs or have any comments regarding the
Course Builder, these can be directed to
<a href="mailto:handbook@nist.gov">the e-Handbook team</a>.

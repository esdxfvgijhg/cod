Prerequisites

</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=85%>
In order to install Course Builder, you need the following
software:
<ul>
   <li>Perl (version 5.0 or higher)
   <li>A web server (e.g., Apache or IIS)
   <li>For Windows platforms, the command line support plugin for
       <a href="http://www.winzip.com/wzcline.htm"
          target="external">WinZip</a>
</ul>
Perl is a freely downloadable scripting language.  Most Unix/Linux
platforms will already have Perl installed.  Perl can be downloaded
from the <a href=
"http://www.activestate.com/Products/Download/Get.plex?id=ActivePerl"
target="external">
Active States web site</a>.
<p>
There are a large number of web servers (both commercial and
public domain).  It is assumed that your local site already has a
web server installed.  If not, then the Apache web server can be
freely downloaded for Unix/Linux and Microsoft Windows platforms.
<p>
It is also assumed that Course Builder will be installed by a
web administrator (or at least by someone with basic familiarity with
web servers and CGI scripts).  It is simply beyond our scope to
document web servers and CGI scripting.

Course Builder runs as a Perl-based CGI script.  It has been

</ul>
As we are not experts on web servers, we will not formally support
Course Builder in other environments.  However, a local web
administrator should be able to port it to other web servers,
operating systems, or browsers with minimal effort.

<I>Download the Perl Script</I>

The first step is to download the
<A TARGET="_parent" HREF="course-builder.perl">Perl script for Course
Builder</a>.  You can download this to a temporary location of
your choice (later instructions will document where to move it).
You should save it with the name "course-builder.pl".
<p>
You can check the syntax of the script by entering the following
command:
<ul>
     perl -c course-builder.pl
</ul>

Configure the Web Server

</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=85%>
You need to perform some configuration for the web server:
<ul>
   <li><a href="#apache_windows">Apache Server (Windows platforms)</a>
   <li><a href="#apache_unix">Apache Server (Unix/Linux platforms)</a>
   <li><a href="#iis">IIS Server (Windows only)</a>
</ul>
If you have a different web server, you will need to perform
similar configuration tasks.  Consult your local web server
administrator for assistance.
<p>
The basic task is to define where the e-Handbook files
and CGI scripts reside on your local platform.

</ol>
In addition, you should create the directory "cgi-bin" in
the e-Handbook directory.  For example, if you have installed
the e-Handbook in
<ul>
    C:\HTDOCS\e-Handbook
</ul>
then enter the following command from a Command prompt window (or
use Windows Explorer to create the directory)
<ul>
    mkdir C:\HTDOCS\e-Handbook\cgi-bin

Once this directory has been created, move the "course-builder.pl"
file to this directory.

Modifications to the Course Builder Perl Script
</I>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=85%>
You may need to make a few changes to the Course Builder Perl
script.  Specifically,
<ul>
   <li>The first line of the "course-builder.pl" script identifies
       the path for Perl on your system.  For Unix/Linux
       installtions, this is usually one of the following:
       <p>
       <ul>
          <li>#!/usr/bin/perl
          <li>#!/usr/local/bin/perl
       </ul>
       <p>
       For Windows platforms, it is usually the following
       <p>
       <ul>
          <li>#!c:/Perl/bin/Perl.exe
       </ul>
       <p>
       This path needs to match the location where Perl is
       installed on your local system.  If you are not sure
       where this is, contact your local system administrator.
       <p>
   <li>Check the line
       <p>
       <ul>
          $HANDBOOK_URL = '/index.htm'
       </ul>
       <p>
       This is the path to the e-Handbook's starting page
       relative to "http://server/" where "server" is the root
       page for your web browser.
       <p>
   <li>Check the line
       <p>
       <ul>
          $SCRATCH_DIRECTORY = '/tmp'
       </ul>
       <p>
       This is the path to a working directory where the Course
       Builder creates temporary folders.  You can set this
       to any convenient directory.
       <p>
   <li>Change the line
       <p>
       <ul>
          $UNIX = 0; # 1 = TRUE, 0 = FALSE
       </ul>
       <p>
       Set this value to 0 for Windows platforms and to 1 for
       Unix/Linux platforms.
       <p>
   <li>For Unix/Linux platforms, change the line
       <p>
       <ul>
          $PACKAGER_EXE = 'wzzip'
       </ul>
       <p>
       to
       <p>
       <ul>
          $PACKAGER_EXE = 'tar -cvf'
       </ul>
       <p>
       Leave this line as is for Windows platforms.
       <p>
       This defines the command used to bundle up the files
       created by the Course Builder (WinZip for Windows, tar
       for Unix/Linux).
</ul>
Note that for all path names above, the forward slash "/" is
always used for both Unix and Windows platforms.

Boundary Issue for Internet Explorer (MIME Multipart/mixed)

</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=85%>
The Course Builder perl script has browser dependent code that
separates "pages" from one another when printing the HTML code to
the browser.
<p>
This is supported with Mozilla/Netscape browsers.  However, the
Microsoft Internet Explorer browser just prints the file to the
screen rather than saving the file as expected.  To resolve this
problem, the script detects the browsers.  For Mozilla/Netscape
browsers, it will ask where to save the file.  For Internet Explorer,
it will ask to download the file using a link.

Zip and tar Issues
</I>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=85%>
The Course Builder perl script can use any external command
application to compress the files generated by Course Builder.  By
default, it uses the command line version of WinZip for Windows and
tar for Unix/Linux platforms.  If you have a different tool
available locally, modify the "$PACKAGER_EXE" variable in
"course-build.pl" to define the appropriate command to use.
<p>
The script can use just one compression application.  If you want
to run Course Builder from both Windows and Unix desktops, one
solution is to have two scripts; one for Windows (i.e., using
WinZip) and one for Unix/Linux (i.e., using tar).  Then let the user
decide which script to run.
<p>
You need to have the <a href=http://www.winzip.com/wzcline.htm"
target="external"> WinZip plugin for command line support</a>
(windows only) installed in order to create zip files with the script.
<p>
Note that WinZIP can open tar files created by Course Builder
running on Unix/Linux platforms (WinZip does not create tar
files, but it can extract them).

The Course Builder places a logo on all the pages that it creates.
The default logo is a NIST logo.  It is recommended
that you replace this with a logo more appropriate for your local
site.  The simplest way to do this is to simply replace the image
located in "cbuild\c-logo.gif" with a local logo.

<i>What to do after equality of means is rejected</i>

<!-- Add main text below -->
When processes are compared and the null hypothesis of equality
(or homogeneity) is rejected, all we know at that point is that
there is no equality amongst them.  But we do not know the form
of the inequality.

<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=85%>
<!-- Add main text below -->
Questions concerning the reason for the rejection of the null
hypothesis arise in the form of:
<ul>
   <li>"Which mean(s) or proportion (s) differ from a standard or
       from each other?"
       <p>
   <li>"Does the mean of treatment 1 differ from that of
       treatment 2?"

   <li>"Does the average of treatments 1 and 2 differ from the
       average of treatments 3 and 4?"

<i>Multiple Comparison test procedures are needed</i>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=85%>
<!-- Add main text below -->
One popular way to investigate the cause of rejection of the null
hypothesis is a <i>Multiple Comparison Procedure.</i>  These are
methods which examine or compare more than one pair of means or
proportions at the same time.
<p>
<a NAME="Note"></a><b><u>Note</u></b>: Doing pairwise comparison
procedures over and over again for all possible pairs will not, in
general, work.  This is because the overall significance level is
not as specified for a single pair comparison.

ANOVA F test is a preliminary test
</I>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=85%>
<!-- Add main text below -->
The ANOVA uses the F test to determine whether there exists a
significant difference among treatment means or interactions.  In
this sense it is a preliminary test that informs us if we should
continue the investigation of the data at hand.
<p>
If the null hypothesis (no difference among treatments or
interactions) is accepted, there is an implication that no relation
exists between the factor levels and the response.  There is not
much we can learn, and we are finished with the analysis.
<p>
When the F test rejects the null hypothesis, we usually want to
undertake a thorough analysis of the nature of the factor-level
effects.

       Two Factor Means</a></li>

Determine contrasts in advance of observing the experimental results
</I>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=85%>
<!-- Add main text below -->
These types of investigations should be done on combinations of
factors that were determined in advance of observing the
experimental results, or else the confidence levels are not as
specified by the procedure.  Also, doing several comparisons might
change the overall confidence level (see <a href="#Note">note</a>
above).  This can be avoided by carefully selecting contrasts to
investigate in advance and making sure that:
<ul>
   <li>the number of such contrasts does not exceed the number of
       degrees of freedom between the treatments</li>
   <li>only <a href="prc426.html#Definition and Estimation of">
       orthogonal contrasts</a> are chosen.</li>
</ul>
However, there are also several powerful multiple comparison
procedures we can use after observing the experimental results.

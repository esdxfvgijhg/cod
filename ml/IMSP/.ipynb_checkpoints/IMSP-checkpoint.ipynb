    "### Basic Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let us extend in a more practical way the *“word count”* example from the previous section. We will read data from numerous text files, count the word occurrences, and save the results as text files. \n",
    "\n",
    " Let us assume that */tmp/TP_Spark* is our working directory. In the data set, you will find a subdirectory named *spark-docs* containing the Spark documentation in *.md files.* \n",
    " \n",
    " You have to use *SparkContext’s textFile* method, that reads one or more text files and creates an RDD, where each element is one line of the text file(s). The argument of the function is the path to the file(s) and it accepts wildcards, so that you can read at once all the *.md* files in the *spark-docs* directory. \n",
    " \n",
    "Then, transform the resulting RDD (where each element is a whole line) to into a new *wordsRDD*, where each element is a single word. For the purpose, use the *flatMap* operation, which allows for a single RDD element to be transformed into multiple elements in the returned RDD. \n",
    "\n",
    "The *flatMap* transformation function should return a collection instead of a single value; like in the previous example, use space as a delimiter to split a line into words. Then, use the same map and *reduceByKey* operations as in the previous example to create the *wordCount* final RDD and save it as text into */tmp/TP_Spark/output.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that *saveAsTextFile* creates the directory specified with the argument and creates many files named *part-XXXXX* that correspond to the partitions of the final RDD. It also requires that the destination directory do not exist, so if you rerun this example, make sure to delete the *output* directory.\n",

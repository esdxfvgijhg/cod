I was all, I dunno if he was gassin' me or not. . but he's like he wanna manage me as a rapper AND a producer ""I'll sign you as a producer and a rapper"",. . I'm like oh shit. . I was messin with, uh, D-Dot also. . People were like this, started talking about the Ghost production. . But that's how I got in the game. If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be here. . So you know. After they picked that Truth beat. . I was figuring I was gonna do some more work. . But shit just went poppin off like that. I was stayin in Chicago. . I had my own apartment. I be doin' like, just beats for local acts. . just to try to keep the lights on, and then to go out and buy. . get a Pelle Pelle off lay-away, get some Jordans or something. . or get a TechnoMarine, that's what we wore back then. . I made this one beat where I sped up this Hal Melville sample. . I played it for Hip over the phone, he's like ""oh, yo that shit is crazy. . Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin, called The Dynasty."". . And at that time, like the drums really weren't soundin' right to me. . so I went and um, I was listening to Dre Chronic 2001 at that time. . and really I just, like picked the drums off Xxplosive and put it like. . with it sped up, sampled, and now it's kind of like my whole style. . when it started, when he rapped on 'This Can't be Life.'. . And that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was on the Dynasty album. . I could say that was the, the resurgence of this whole sound. . You know, I got to come in and track the beat, and at the time. . I was still with my other management. I really wanted to roll with. . Hiphop. 'Cause I, I just needed some fresh air, you know what I'm. . sayin, 'cause I been there for a while, I appreciated what they did. . for me, but, you know there's a time in every man's life where he. . gotta make a change, try to move up to the next level. And that day I. . came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet Jay-Z and he said, ""oh. . you a real soulful dude"" . And he. . uh, played the song 'cause he already spit his verse by the time I got. . to the studio, you know how he do it, one take. And he said ""check this out, tell me what you think of this, right here"". . ""tell me what you think of this."" And I heard it, and I was thinking. . like, man, I really wanted more like of the simple type Jay-Z, I ain't. . want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the, in my. . personal opinion. So he asked me, ""what you think of it?"" ""so what you thinkin?"". . And I was like, ""man that shit tite,"". . you know what I'm sayin', man what I'ma tell him? I was on the train. . man, you know. So after that I went back home. And man I'm, I'm just. . in Chicago, I'm trying to do my thing. You know, I got groups. I got. . acts I'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin really like. . poppin' off the way it should have been. One of my homeys that was one. . of my artists, he got signed. But it was supposed to really go through. . my production company, but he ended up going straight with the. . company. So, like I'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad. . news that dude was tryin' to leave my company. And I got evicted at. . the same time. So I went down and tracked the beats from him, I took. . that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a U-Haul, maybe about. . ten days before I had to actually get out. So I ain't have to deal. . with the landlord 'cause he's a jerk. Me and my mother drove to ""Come on, let's just go"". . Newark, New Jersey. I hadn't even seen my apartment.. . I remember I pulled up ""Kanye, baby, we're here"",. . I unpacked all my shit. You know, we went to Ikea, I bought a. . bed, I put the bed together myself. I loaded up all my equipment, and. . the first beat I made was, uh, 'Heart of the City.'. . And Beans was still working on his album at that time, so I came up. . there to Baseline, it was Beans' birthday, matter of fact, and I. . played like seven beats. And, you know I could see he's in the zone. . he already had the beats that he wanted, I did nothing like already at. . that time. But then Jay walked in. I remember he had a GuccI bucket. . hat on. I remember it like, like it was yesterday. And Hiphop said. . ""yo play that one beat for him."" And I played 'Heart of the City.' And. . really I made 'Heart of the City,' I really wanted to give that beat to DMX. ""No I think Jay gon' like this one right here"".. . And I played another beat, and I played another beat. And I remember that. . GuccI bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of. . them faces like 'OOOOOOOOOOH.' Two days later I'm in Baseline and I seen. . Dame. Dame didn't know who I was and I was like ""yo what's up I'm Kanye."" ""Yo, you that kid, Kanye?"". . ""You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay?. . Yo, this nigga got classics"" ""Jay got classics, G."". . You know I ain't talkin shit.. . I'm like ""oh shit."" And all this time I'm starstruck, man. I'm. . still thinking 'bout, you know I'm picturing these niggaz on the show. . The Streets is Watching, I'm lookin, these were superstars in my. . eyes. And they still are, you know. So, Jay came in and he spit all. . these songs like in one day, and in two days... I gotta bring up one. . thing, you know, come back to the story, the day I did the 'Can't be. . Life' beat on track, I remember Lenny S, he had some Louis Vuitton. . sneakers on, he think he fly. And Hiphop was there, I think Tata, John. . Minnelli, a bunch of people. I didn't know all these people at the. . time they was in the room, and I said, ""yo Jay I could rap."" And I. . spit this rap that said, uh ""I'm killin y'all niggaz on that lyrical. . shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips."" And I saw his. . eyes light up when I said that line. But you know the West, the rap. . was like real wack and shit, so that's all the response.. . He said ""man that was tite."" ""That, that was cool. That was hot."". . That was it. You know, I ain't get no deal then, hehe.. . Okay, fast forward.. . So, Blueprint, H to the Izzo, my first hit single. And I just. . took that proudly, built relationships with people. My relationship. . with KwelI I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my. . career as a rapper. Because, you know, of course later he allowed me. . to go on tour with him. Man, I appre-- I love him for that. And at. . this time, you know I didn't have a deal, I had songs, and I had. . relationships with all these A&R's, and they wanted beats from me, so. . they'd call me up, I'd play them some beats. ""Gimme a beat that sound. . like Jay-Z."" You know, they dick riders. Whatever. So I'll play them. . these post-Blueprint beats or whatever and then I'll play my shit. I'll. . be like, ""yo but I rap too."" Hey, I guess they was lookin' at me crazy. . 'cause you know, 'cause I ain't have a jersey on or whatever. . Everybody out there listen here. I played them 'Jesus Walks' and they. . didn't sign me. You know what happened, it was some A&R's that fucked. . with me though, but then like the heads, it'd be somebody at the. . company that'll say ""naw."" Like, Dave LottI fucked with me, my. . nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels. Jessica Rivera, man ""Man, you niggaz is stupid if y'all don't sign Kanye, for real."". . I'm not gonna say nothin to mess my promotion up. . ""Y'all niggaz is stupid"". Let's just say I didn't get my deal.. . The nigga that was behind me, I mean,. . he wasn't even a nigga, you know?. . The person who actually kicked everything off was Joe 3H from Capitol. . Records. He wanted to sign me really bad. ""We gonna change the game, buddy."". . Dame was like, ""yo you got a deal with Capitol,. . okay man, just make sure it's not wack."" ""you gotta make sure it's not wack."". . Then one day I just went ahead and played it, I wanted to. . play some songs, 'cause you know Cam was in the room, Young Guru, and. . Dame was in the room. So I played... actually it's a song that you'll. . never hear, but maybe I might use it. So, it's called 'Wow.'. . ""I go to Jacob with 25 thou, you go with 25 hundred, wow. . I got eleven plaques on my walls right now. . You got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow."". . Like the chorus went. Don't bite that chorus, I might still use it. So. . I play that song for him, and he's like ""oh shit"" ""Oh shit it's not even wack."". . ""I ain't gonna front, it's kinda hot."" ""it's actually kinda hot."". . Like they still weren't looking at me. . like a rapper. And I'm sure Dame figured, 'like man. If he do a whole. . album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and. . save the album, you know. So uh Dame took me into the office, and he's. . like ""yo man, we, we on a brick, we on a brick"" ""you don't wanna catch a brick"". . You gotta be under an umbrella, you'll get rained on.. . I told Hiphop and Hiphop was all, ""oh, word?"" Actually, even with. . that I was still about to take the deal with Capitol 'cause it was. . already on the table and 'cause of my relationship with 3H. That, you. . know, 'cause I told him I was gonna do it, and I'm a man of my word, I. . was gonna roll with what I said I was gonna do. Then, you know, I'm. . not gonna name no names, but people told me, ""oh he's just a producer. . rapper"" and told 3H that told the heads of the Capitol, and right--. . the day I'm talking about, I planned out everything I was gonna do. . man, I had picked out clothes, I already started booking studio. . sessions, I started arranging my album, thinking of marketing schemes. . man I was ready to go. And they had Mel call me, they said. . ""yo... Capitol pulled on the deal"" ""Yo, Capitol pulled out on the deal."". . And, you know I told them that Rocafella was interested. . and I don't know if they thought that was just something I was saying. . to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever. I went up... I. . called G, I said, ""man, you think we could still get that deal with Rocafella?"". "

Historically, I'm kickin' bitches out like Pam, nigga. Goin' HAM nigga, me and Jigga. and a nigga still young, wanna have no kids. But I've been practicing with some actresses as bad as shit.

Really you got baby money. Keep it real with niggas. niggas ain't got my lady money. Watch the Throne don't step on our road. Bad enough we let you step on our globe. When my nephew died, daddy dead. niggas took the price on my uncles head. Nobody called the cops as my uncle bled. So I feel like I would like to know my uncles bread. Bow down, brother pay homage. don't spill hate all on my garments. Commes Des Garcon, fuck your fresh. head shots nigga fuck your vests. fuck the pig, no pork on my fork.

"Watch The Throne","Primetime",". . . . . We in the time of our lives baby. Turn the music up, primetime. Yeah, primetime, beat by Dion, our third eon. That’s what the fuck we on. Mo’ money, 40 year old phenom. My 15 minutes of fame has stretched beyond. At 42 be better than 24, I carried the 4-5, mastered 48 laws. Still wearing my 23’s they can’t fuck with the boy. As far as them 16’s, I’m 23 of it all. Primetime, riding that 6 deuce. That 9-11 I only subtract the roof. Started in 88’, got warm in 92’, I landed in 96’. That’s the year I came through. I hit the club, ordered some Grey Goose. Switched it for Ciroc to give Puff’s stock a boost. New money, I found the fountain of youth. I’m headed to Miami to fuck up the Fontaine Bleu. A case of Ace, make it 2, nigga we rolling, beat the deuce. The night is young, what the fuck we gon’ do (ooh). The night is young, what the fuck you wanna do, huh. The night is young, what the fuck we gon’ do, huh. The night is young, what you really wanna do, huh. Primetime, basking in the lime. Cassius in his prime, coloring out of the line. Cause they don’t want nobody that’s colored out of the lines. So I’m late as a motherfucker, colored people time. Damn Yeezy, they all gotta be dimes?. Well, Adam gave up a rib so mine better be prime. Niggas gon’ kill me, I swear they better be lying. I never live in fear, I’m too out of my mind. Primetime, never hit these heights. I mean it’s like, it’s like our first 1st class flight. I’m trippin’ on it, socks on marble floors. I’m slippin’ on it, champagne, I’m sippin’ on it. Shit taste different, don’t it?. You know what, you right. It’s like the best damn champagne I had in my life. “When you coming home” That’s a text from my wife. I told her, run a bubble bath. And float in that motherfucker like a hovercraft. And soak in that motherfucker til I call you back. I mean who says shit like that, and doesn’t laugh (un-huh). The night is young, what the fuck you wanna do, huh. The night is young, what the fuck we gon’ do, huh. The night is young, what you really wanna do, huh. "
"Watch The Throne","The Joy",". . . . . Add a little sugar, honeysuckle lamb. A great big expression of happiness. Boy, you couldn't miss with a dozen roses. Such would astound you. The joy of children laughing around you. These are all the makings of you. I do it for the forefathers and the street authors. That are now A&Rs in the cheap office. Rappers that never got signed but they keep offers. Girls that's way too fine for us to keep off of. Gave her a handshake only for my man’s sake. She in her birthday suit cause of the damn cake. Now there’s crumbs all over the damn place. And she want me to cum all over her damn face. I never understood planned parenthood. Cause I never met nobody plan to be a parent in the hood. Taking refills of that Plan B pill. Another shorty that won’t make it to the family will. If I don’t make it, can’t take it, hope the family will. They ain't crazy, they don’t know how insanity feel. Don C just had a shorty, so it’s not that bad. But I still hear the ghosts of the kids I never had. No electro, no metro, a little retro, ahh, perfecto. You know the demo, your boy act wild. You ain't get the memo? Yeezy’s back in style. Now one room got Gidget, the other got Bridget. What’s more tripped out, dawg, is they sisters. Nah, you ain't listen, they black, they ""sisters"". They momma named them after white bitches. So next time you see me on your fallopian. Though the jewelry’s Egyptian, know the hunger’s Ethiopian. Stupid questions like “Is he gon' be dope again?. Have you seen him? has anybody spoke to him?”. This beat deserves Hennessy, a bad bitch. And a bag of weed; the Holy Trinity. In the mirror where I see my only enemy. Your life’s cursed, well mine’s an obscenity. This is my momma shit; I used to hear this. Through the walls in the hood when I was back in my pajama shit. Afros and marijuana sticks, seeds and the ganja had it. Popping like the sample that I’m rhyming with. Pete Rock, let the needle drop. I seen so much as a kid they surprised I don’t needle pop. Taking sips of pop, six pack of Miller nips. Pink Champale, Ballantine Ale. Bally’s on my feet help me balance out well. That and the shit I used to balance on the scale. I got it honest from the parties from my momma’s. Virgin Marys try to judge her. I’m like “Where the Madonnas now?”. Give all glory to Gloria. They said “you raised that boy too fast, but you was raising a warrior”. We victorious, they’ll never take the joy from us, uh. Keep your hands up, get mine up. Don’t let them take your fire. Yeah, okay. (It’s Pete Rock, Kanye, one, two, okay). "

These niggas tryna hold me back"", I'm just trying to protect my stacks. Mitt Romney don't pay no tax, Mitt Romney don't pay no tax. Chi-Town 'til I'm on my back, Chi-Town 'til I'm on my back. Only nigga in Beverly Hills, where the hell is Axle Foley at?. ""Ease up there baby boy"", Ving Rhames told Jody that. R. Kelly and the God of rap. shitting on you, holy crap.

"Cruel Summer","Sin City",". . . . . 10 a.m. it's west side bitch. She see the glasses, so obvious. Run from home, after tonight we up out of here. Don't go home cause they just ran me up out of there. All of those drunken nights then fuckin' every night. She run her mouth, but can't eat right. Don't read between the line and forgot how to be white. She smelled the line, baby you know you don't need white. Now look what we did now, the cops behind us. Ran that red light, did you have to be mindless?. SMH, we all know that cocaine killed Abel. From the scholar letters devour this. She stepped into hell, cause winter got cold. Don't look in her eyes, you might see straight to her soul. Don't say yes to that good, cause you'll never know. Cause we lost in the city where sin is no biggy. I'm here with open arms and I gotta. Here is where her heart belongs. Her heart belongs to me. Here is where her heart. I'm here and I won't go. Without her, this is where her heart belongs. It should be here with me. Here is where her heart. I beg for mercy today. They won't take me away. Take me away from you. Don't know what I would do. Don't let us die in vain. Don't let them see our pain. Wash these demons away. Wash these demons away. You are all unwelcome to Sin City. Yet the population still increases its density. And that increases its intensity. Which increases the propensity.

I'm in the loop, warm tie like a ascot. I used to run with the have-nots. Kept the ave hot just so we could have knots. A lot of niggaz see they dreams in a glass pot.

I went to Cannes with a tan bitch, Francis. She rode the broom on the beach, that's a sand witch. So I ate her like it, haters hate to like it. Sex, drugs, and playin' dices, those are our favorite vices. But this life'll take a toll on ya. Well I guess you gotta pay the prices. I know who Christ is. And he never hung with the Saints it makes no sense to save the righteous. By the age ten, we were caged in. Now they raise men in the state pen. Fake friends, forgive 'em for they sins. God bless the city, amen. And now I'm one of the residents. They walk with none of the repercuss', but all of the decadence. And all the fuckin' debauchery. Adult film star, somebody's fuckin' watchin' me. I always feel like, I'm almost feel like. Cause I could feel it in the air tonight. I did some wrongs I wouldn't dare to right. And wrote some songs I wouldn't dare recite. But I am willing to share tonight. In the city that is as unfair as life. "

'Til the wheels fall off, 'til the wheels don't spin. To 3 A.M., callin'. How many real friends?. Just to ask you a question. Just to see how you was feelin'. How many?. For the last you was frontin'. I hate when a nigga text you like, ""what's up, fam, oh you good?"". You say, ""I'm good"" then great, the next text they ask you for somethin'. How many?. What's best for your family, immediate or extended. Any argument, the media'll extend it. I had a cousin that stole my laptop that I was fuckin' bitches on. Paid that nigga 250 thousand just to get it from him. Real friends. Huh?. Real friends. I guess I get what I deserve, don't I. Word on the streets is they ain't heard from him. I guess I get what I deserve, don't I. Talked down on my name, throwed dirt on him. "

No more (Los Angeles). Please (shake that body, party that bod-). Please (shake that body, party that body). Please (shake that body, party that body). Hey baby you forgot your Ray Bans. And my sheets still orange from your spray tan. It was more than soft porn for the K-man. She remember my Sprinter, said ""I was in the grape van"". Uhm, well cutie, I like your bougie booty. Come Erykah Badu me, well, let's make a movie. Hell, you know my repertoire is like a wrestler. I show you the ropes, connect the dots. A country girl that love Hollywood. Mama used to cook red beans and rice. Now it's Denny's, 4 in the morning, spoil your appetite. Liquor pouring and niggas swarming your section with erection. Smoke in every direction, middle finger pedestrians. R&B singers and lesbians, rappers and managers. Music and iPhone cameras. This shit unanimous for you, it's damaging for you, one thing. That pussy should only be holding exclusive rights to me, I mean. He flew you in this motherfucker on first class. Even went out his way so you could check in an extra bag. Now you wanna divide the yam like it equate the math?. That shit don't add up, you're making them mad as fuck. She said she came out here to find an A-list rapper. I said baby, spin that round and say the alphabet backwards. You're dealing with malpractice, don't kill a good nigga's confidence. Just cause he a nerd and you don't know what a condom is. The head still good though, the head still good though. Ladies say ""Nam Myoho Renge Kyo"". Make a nigga say big words and act lyrical. Make me get spiritual. Make me believe in miracles, Buddhist monks and Cap'n Crunch cereal. Lord have mercy, thou will not hurt me. Five buddies all herded up on a Thursday. Bottle service, head service, I came in first place. The opportunity, the proper top of breast and booty cheek. The pop community, I mean these bitches come with union fee. And I want two of these, moving units through consumer streets. Then my shoe released, she was kicking in gratuity. And yeah G, I was all for it. She said K Lamar, you kind of dumb to be a poet. I'mma put you on game for the lames that don't know they're a rookie. Instagram is the best way to promote some pussy. Scary. Scary. No more parties in LA. Please, baby, no more parties in LA. Friday night tryna make it into the city. Breakneck speeds, passenger seat something pretty. Thinking back to how I got here in the first place. Second class bitches wouldn't let me on first base. A backpack nigga with luxury taste buds. And the Louis Vuitton store, got all of my pay stubs. Got pussy from beats I did for niggas more famous. When did I become A list? I wasn't even on a list. Strippers get invited to where they only get hired. When I get on my Steve Jobs, somebody gon' get fired. I was uninspired since Lauryn Hill retired. And 3 Stacks, man, you preach it to the choir. Any rumor you heard about me was true and legendary. I done got Lewinsky and paid secretaries. For all my niggas with babies by bitches. That use their kids as meal tickets. Not knowing the disconnect from the father. The next generation will be the real victims. I can't fault 'em really. I remember Amber told my boy no matter what happens she ain't going back to Philly. Back to our regularly scheduled programmin'. Of weak content of slow jammin'. But don't worry, this one's so jammin'. You know it, L.A., it's so jammin'. I be thinkin' every day. Mulholland Drive, need to put up some god damn barricades. I be paranoid every time. The pressure, the problem ain't I be drivin'. The problem is I be textin'. My psychiatrist got kids that I inspired. First song they played for me was 'bout their friend that just died. Textin' and drivin' down Mulholland Drive. That's why I'd rather take the 405. I be worried 'bout my daughter, I be worried 'bout Kim. But Saint is baby Ye, I ain't worried 'bout him. I had my life threatened by best friends who had selfish intents. What I'm supposed to do?. Ride around with a bulletproof car and some tints?. Every agent I know know I hate agents. I'm too black, I'm too vocal, I'm too flagrant. Something smellin' like shit, that's the new fragrance. It's just me, I do it my way, bitch. Some days I'm in my Yeezys, some days I'm in my Vans. If I knew y'all made plans I wouldn't have popped the Xans. I know some fans who thought I wouldn't rap like this again. But the writer's block is over, emcees cancel your plans. I'm 38 years old, a 8 year old with rich nigga problems. Tell my wife that I hate the Rolls so I ain't never drive it. It took 6 months to take the Maybach all matted out. And my assistant crashed as soon as they backed it out. God damn, got a bald fade, I might slam. Pink fur, got Nori dressing like Cam, thank God for me. Whole family gettin' money, thank God for E!. I love rockin' jewelry, a whole neck full. Bitches say he funny and disrespectful. I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my shoes. I feel like Pablo when I see me on the news. I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my house. Tell 'em party's in here, we don't need to go out. We need the turbo thots, high speed, turbo thots. Drop-dro-dro-dro-drop it like Robocop. She brace herself and hold my stomach, good dick'll do that. She keep pushin' me back, good dick'll do that. She push me back when the dick go too deep. This good dick'll put your ass to sleep. Get money, money, money, money. Big, big money, money, money, money. And as far as real friends, tell my cousins I love 'em. Even the one that stole the laptop, you dirty motherfucker. I just keep on lovin' you, baby. And there's no one else I know who can take your place. Please, no more parties in LA. Please, baby, no more parties in LA, uh. No more parties in LA. Please, baby, no more parties in LA, uh. No more parties in LA. Please, baby, no more parties in LA, uh. No more (Los Angeles). I'm out here from a very far away place. All for a chance to be a star.

"The Life Of Pablo","Saint Pablo",". . . . . Yeah, 9: 08 L.A. time. Back in the lab and shit. My wife said, I can't say no to nobody. And at this rate we gon' both die broke. Got friends that ask me for money knowing I'm in debt. And like my wife said, I still didn't say no. People tryna say I'm going crazy on Twitter. My friends best advice was to stay low. I guess it's hard to decipher all of the bills. Especially when you got family members on payroll. The media said it was outlandish spending. The media said he's way out of control. I just feel like I'm the only one not pretending. I'm not out of control, I'm just not in their control. I know I'm the most influential. That TIME cover was just confirmation. This generation's closest thing to Einstein. So don't worry about me, I'm fine. I can see a thousand years from now in real life. Skate on the paradigm and shift it when I feel like. Grow conventional thought, don't need to question. I know it's antiquated so sometimes I get aggressive. Thank God For Jay Electra, he down with the mission. Did it with no permission, on our own conditions. Most Blacks with money have been beaten to submission. Yeezy with the big house, did it way different. Never listen to Hollywood producers.

Father, father, father. Wondering whether God's gonna say hi. The night sky, I feel like I'm home, baby. I've been waking the spirits of millions more to come. A million illegally downloaded my truth over the drums. I believe in the children, listen to the kids, bro. If the phone ringing, go and get your kids ho. Brother Don Muhammad told the minister about the presentation. He sat back and smiled. Black on black lies is worse than black on black crime. The Jews share they truth on how to make a dime. Most black men couldn't balance a cheque-book. But buy a new car, talking 'bout how my neck look?. Well it all looks great. Four hundred years later, we buying our own chains. The light is before us brothers, so the devil working hard. Real family stick together and see through the mirage. The smokescreens, perceptions of false reality. Who the real owner if your boss gets a salary?. I am one with the people. I am one with the people, real. I've awoken from an enlightened man's dream. Checking Instagram comments to crowd-source my self-esteem. Let me not say too much or do too much. Cause if I'm up way too much, I'm out of touch. I'm praying a out-of-body experience will happen. So the people can see my light, now it's not just rapping. God, I have humbled myself before the court. Drop my ego and confidence was my last resort. I know, I know he got a plan, I know I'm on your beams. One set of footsteps, you was carrying me. When I turned on the news and they was burying me. One set of footsteps, you was carrying me. When I was negotiating with Apple, it was Larry and me. Told Tim Cook to call me, I was scary to see. I would've took a hundred million and gave twenty to Hov.

Only thing I ask is next time I'm on stage we all go. We all go. Not just by myself, looking for niggas like where's Waldo. She got the same shoes as my wife but she copped 'em at Aldo. Modern day MJ with an off-the-wall flow. Nightlife, walk all over me. Walk all over me. I'm delivering everything I've ever sent to you, bring. Fly, fly, fly overseas. Fly overseas.

And you wonder where is God in your nightlife. Yeah, you're looking at the church in the night sky. Wondering whether God's gonna say hi. Yeah, you're looking at the church in the night sky. And you wonder where is God in your nightlife. Please face me when I speak. Please say to me something before you leave. You've been treating me like I'm invisible. Now I'm visible to you, oh, the invisible truths. Stay sober. I don't quite understand the games you play. Understand, understand. Understand I'm standing under oath. And I promised I, I wouldn't fall anymore. While I'm crying at the bar. I'm wishing that you saw my scars, man. I'm wishing that you came down here. And stood by me. And look at me like you knew me. But I feel so alone. Like I don't know anyone except the night sky above. And you're looking at the church in the night sky. Wondering whether God's gonna say hi. Are we looking at the church in the night sky?. And you wonder where is God in your nightlife. Yeah, you're looking at the church in the night sky. Father, father, father.

There are two general types of patients in the data, flu patients and healthy (this is recorded in the column labeled `flu`, a 0 indicates the absences of the virus and a 1 indicates presence). Furthermore, scientists have found that there are two strains of the virus, each requiring a different type of treatment (this is recorded in the column labeled `flutype`, a 1 indicates the absences of the virus, a 2 indicates presence of strain 1 and a 3 indicates the presence of strain 2).\n",

Strain 2 has a more expensive early intervention as well as a more costly treatment for flu complications, but patients with strain 2 has a lower rate of developing complications if treated with the wrong intervention. With no intervention, flu patients develop complications at the same rate regardless of the strain. \n",

    "**Your task:** build a model to predict if a given patient has the flu and identify the flu strain. The state government of MA will use your model to inform public health policies: we will vaccinate people you've identified as healthy and apply corresponding interventions to patients with different strains of the flu. We have provided you with a function to compute the total expected cost of this policy decision that takes into account the cost of the vaccine, the interventions and the cost of the treatments for flu complications resulting from misdiagnosing patients. Your goal is to make sure your model produces a public health policy with the lowest associated expected cost.\n",

The first location for those unwanted definitions is the Undeclared namespace in VisualWorks. Please read the ''VisualWorks Application Developer''s Guide'' for explanations about the Undeclared dictionary/namespace, its usage, and its significance for you, the developer. Second, methods may refer to variables not defined by denoting their name using a dot-notation, like in ''Test.Help.Class''. While this reference indicates a variable named ''Class'' in a namespace called ''Help'', which is inside a namspace called ''Test'', it does not define this variable. Therefore, if one of the objects mentioned above is not defined, there will be no entry into the Undeclared namespace, so we provide a special finder for the erroneous methods, look further down for instructions. Starting up the tool will first clean up Undeclared programmatically, so the browser will only display ''real'' undeclareds. Due to this clean up, it takes a while to open the browser. If you want to skip the cleaning, hold down the shift key while opening the tool.The User InterfaceThe browser displays all variable bindings of the Undeclared namespace in a list in the upper left corner. Below the list is a Checkbox allowing you to filter those entries from the list, which are only there because of a method belonging to an absent class. This is perfectly normal, as Parcels can contain methods for classes belonging to other parcels not currently loaded.Selecting one of the entries will calculate all methods refering to this variable, and display them in a second list to the right. The selection will also display the current content of the selected variable in a text field below the two lists. If you select one of the methods, its source code is displayed in a text view at the bottom of the window. For special purposes explained below, a menu button at the top of the window gives you the opportunity to select a target namespace. Some menu items may be disabled, if StORE is not available in the image.A little help for code integrators has been added to the File menu. If you encounter undeclared variables in code you are not responsible for, you can choose ''File-&gt;FileOutList...'' to save a text file containing a table of undeclareds with their corrsponding references in Wiki-Webpage format. Pasting the contents of the text file on your Wiki server gives your team members immediate access to your findings, and can help to resolve these issues.Intended way of UsageCleaning up Undeclared really means fixing bugs in your software. Because Parcels can contain code for classes currently not in the image, Undeclared may contain variable bindings, which are NOT there because of a bug, but for serving as a forward reference until the class gets loaded. Therefor the following guide is only valid for those entries shown with ''Hide Absent References'' checked. The list may be significantly longer when this option is unchecked, and the result shown when selecting a variable of an absent class'' method is misleading because its mostly not showing buggy code.Each method refering to a variable listed in this browser needs further editing, because it really should refer to:	-	a static variable in the classes namespace (previously known as class variables),	-	a static variable of a name space, previously known as a global variable,	-	a class in another name space, which is not imported to the namespace of 		the class of  the method, and therefore cannot be found, 	-	a class instance variable,	-	an instance variable.The browser will let you select a variable from the Undeclared namespace, which in turn will display all methods refering to this variable. The entries in the list of Undeclareds give some hints using emphasis attributes about their origin regarding NameSpaces:	MyVariable			this name is not defined in any namespace,	MyVariable			this name is defined in one or more namespaces,	MyVariable			this name is defined at least in the selected target namespace.	MyVariable			this name is referenced by an overridden method, the current implementation does not use it, and						it is no longer defined anywhere. Menu pick ''Show Defining NameSpace...'' on the undeclared list menu allows you to search for all namespaces a selected variable might be defined in. Selecting a namespace from the resulting MultipleChoiceDialog will select this namespace to be the target namespace.	If you select a method refering to a variable, its source code can be edited, just as in other browsers. However, the undeclareds created by overridden methods cannot be released that easily, the tool currently does not show the sources of the inactive method, which is still available in the system, but not ready for editing anyway.If you successfully fixed all methods refering to an undeclared variable, you can manually remove this variable name from the undeclareds list using its popUp menu. Or, if you have worked on many methods of many undeclared variables in a row, you can clean up Undeclared programmatically using ''Undeclared-&gt;Update List...'' from the menu bar.Finding more undeclaredsAs described in the introduction, there is another opportunity to introduce undeclared definitions into Smalltalk code. We call it ''Undeclared BindingReferences'', and they can be introduced as follows:1. the programmer accepts a method, and the compiler compains about a     reference, like ''Test.Help.Class refers to a variable which has not been defined''.    The programmer may choose to proceed, and if he does, an undefined binding    has been introduced into the method he accepted.2. code is loaded into the image via Pacel, FileIn, etc., which refers to a variable    using the dot-notation as described above, which is not defined in the image.     The load will not reject the code or indicate the undeclared reference.The GHUndeclaredBrowser provides a menu to find such erroneous references by executing a special CodeCritic-rule for the code of the whole image. Use menu ''Undeclared-&gt; Find Undeclared BindingRefrences ...'' to scan for methods having this error. A progress indicator window will show the scan through the image, the scan may be interrupted. At the end it will open a method list browser with the candidate methods, or, If nothing could be found (which is normal!), a dialog will tell you so. The CodeCritic-Rule ''Undeclared BindingReferences'' is added to the system, and shows up as an additional rule in the ''bugs'' category of the CodeCritic-Tool in the SystemBrowser.Georg Heeg eK Dortmund - Köthen - Zürichwww.heeg.de' runs: (Core.RunArray runs: #(23 271 5 261 6 760 18 994 4 98 20 271 21 1353 3 12 3 13 10 27 11 14 10 68 10 152 26 861 26 22 24 893 52 518) values: ((Core.Array new: 34) at: 1 put: #(#bold #large #serif #underline); at: 3 put: #underline; at: 5 put: #underline; at: 7 put: #bold; at: 9 put: #bold; at: 11 put: #bold; at: 13 put: #bold; at: 15 put: #underline; at: 17 put: #underline; at: 19 put: #bold; at: 21 put: #underline; at: 23 put: #(#bold #italic); at: 25 put: ((Core.Array new: 2) at: 1 put: #bold; at: 2 put: (#color -&gt; Graphics.ColorValue red); yourself); at: 27 put: #bold; at: 29 put: #bold; at: 31 put: #bold; at: 33 put: #bold; yourself)))</body></methods><methods><class-id>Heeg.GHUndeclaredBindingsLintRule</class-id> <category>accessing</category><body package="GH Undeclared Browser">openEditor		| browser |	browser := (GHUndeclaredBrowser basicNew)				fillListWithRule: self;				yourself.	browser open</body></methods><methods><class-id>Heeg.GHUndeclaredBindingsLintRule class</class-id> <category>bugs</category><body package="GH Undeclared Browser">undeclaredBindingReference	"Rule to find undeclared BindingReferences in method sources.	This matches bindings of the type 'Test.Help.Class', which are undefined, but do not show up in the Undeclared namespace.	Some technical comments:		We want to find undefined binding references, which are not of the kind #{Test.Error}, but more like Test.Error.		The rule first determins if the method has an undefined binding using the BlockLintRule approach.		If so, we call #undeclaredBindingReferenceMatchFor:initialAnswer: to detect non-curly-brackets bindings and add them		to the answer set."	| detector |	detector := self new.	detector		name: (#UndeclaredBindingreference &lt;&lt; #browser				&gt;&gt; 'Undeclared BindingReference') asString.	detector methodBlock: 			[:context :result |			| missingBindings bindings |			bindings := context compiledMethod allLiterals select: #isBindingReference.			missingBindings := bindings reject: #isDefined.			missingBindings notEmpty				ifTrue: 					[self undeclaredBindingReferenceMatchFor: context initialAnswer: result]].	^detector</body></methods><methods><class-id>Heeg.GHUndeclaredBindingsLintRule class</class-id> <category>private</category><body package="GH Undeclared Browser">undeclaredBindingReferenceMatchFor: aContext initialAnswer: answerCollection	"We use a ParseTreeSearcher, we only get the source code of the used variable	to analyze the situation.

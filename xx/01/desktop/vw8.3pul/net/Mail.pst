All rights reserved.Comment: This package builds on top of the more abstract MIME framework to provide practical components for dealing with email specifically. It provides MailMessage and MailFileReader allowing for efficient access of mail messages stored in external files (e.g. unix mbox files). It also provides Mailbox as a high-level interface that makes it simple to retrieve, deliver and delete messages from server side mailboxes. NetClients supports three standard email protocols: SMTP for outgoing mail, POP3 for incoming mail, and IMAP for full control over mailboxes on a server. Mail clients implement these specific protocols which carry mail messages between clients and servers. Messages themselves have to be created and formatted as described in the MIME package and below. In building a mail client, you typically need to provide for both sending and receiving mail. POP3 and IMAP are mail receiver clients, and SMTP is a sender client. The mail protocols you choose is determined by the support provided by the server you need to access. For internet ISPs, combining POP3 and SMTP is the most common.	MailboxesThe Mailbox class and its subclasses provide a high-level interface that makes it simple to check mailboxes. There are specific subclasses for IMAP and for POP3, in their protocol specific packages.The following protocol is useful for checking a mailbox:	#allHeaders - Returns a collection of message headers	#anyNewMail - Returns a Boolean; true if there are new messages, false otherwise.	#messageCount - Returns the number of messages in the mailbox.	#getMessage: anInteger - Returns the message, in an instance of LetterInTransit, specified by anInteger.You create either an IMAPMailbox or a Pop3Mailbox, and then you can send any of these messages. For example:	mailbox := IMAPMailbox	"or Pop3Mailbox"		user: (NetUser username: 'nicki' password: 'hox3')		server: 'mail.northpole.net'.	mailbox allHeaders.If there's already an open connection, it is used for the command and left open. If there isn't already a connection, then one is created, and closed upon command completion. 	Sending a MessageNormally, a message is constructed and then sent by an appropriate client (HTTP, SMTP, etc.) using the message protocol for that client (e.g., sendMessage: for SMTPClient). As a convenience, MailMessage defines a send message, which sends the message via the default SMTP server, if one is defined. The server is defined in the Net Settings. A default user may also be specified, but is not required if the message From: line has a legal mail address (name and domain). For example, if a default SMTP server is specified in Net Settings, this should succeed:	message := MailMessage newTextPlain.	message from: 'santa@northpole.net';		to: 'jdoe@abc.com';		subject: 'Start making your list now';		text: 'What would you like for Christmas?';		yourself.	message send.If a default user is also specified, then the from: 'santa@northpole.net' can also be omitted.	Extract the best text representation from a messageSome clients can send a message in alternative formats as separate parts, such as plain text and HTML. The message itself has content type multipart/alternative. Alternates are, by convention, placed in the message in order of increasing complexity, so plain text comes first. Clients that can handle multiple formats, such as plain test and HTML, can specify their own preference order for the version to display, by sending textInPreferenceOrder: to the mail message with an ordered collection of preferences. So, if your client displays HTML, you may prefer that format over plain text, but still use plain text if there is no HTML alternate. Follow the list with asterisk (*) to accept any format in the absence of a preferred format. This example extracts html if available, plain text if not, and the first available if neither of those is available.	message := MailMessage readFrom: message readStream.	message textInPreferenceOrder: #('html' 'plain' '*').For more sample how to build mail messages see the MailBuildHandler class comments.DbIdentifier: bear73DbTrace: 500700DbUsername: tkoganDbVersion: 8.3 - 2DevelopmentPrerequisites: #(#(#any 'MIME' '') #(#any 'NetClientBase' '') #(#any 'Protocols-Common' '') #(#any 'NetSecureConnection' '') #(#any 'TLS' ''))PackageName: MailParcel: #('Mail')ParcelName: MailPrerequisiteDescriptions: #(#(#name 'MIME') #(#name 'NetClientBase' #componentType #package) #(#name 'Protocols-Common' #componentType #package) #(#name 'NetSecureConnection' #componentType #package) #(#name 'TLS' #componentType #package))PrerequisiteParcels: #(#('MIME' '') #('NetClientBase' '') #('Protocols-Common' '') #('NetSecureConnection' '') #('TLS' ''))PrintStringCache: (8.3 - 2,tkogan)Version: 8.3 - 2Date: 2:30:30 PM April 28, 2017 --><time-stamp>From VisualWorks®, Pre-Release 8.3 (apr17.3) of April 28, 2017 on April 28, 2017 at 2:30:30 PM</time-stamp><do-it>(Dialog confirm: 'You are filing-in a Parcel source file!\\While this is possible it will not have\the same effect as loading the parcel.\None of the Parcel''s prerequisites will\be loaded and none of its load actions\will be performed.\\Are you sure you want to file-in?' withCRs) ifFalse: [self error: 'Parcel file-in abandoned.

In general the parser input is expected to be a transient stream (e.g. a socket stream), so the entire content of the message is copied into memory or external files (attachments). Once the message is read in the input stream can be discarded.	Examples:	input := 'From: zz@holcim.comContent-Type: multipart/related;	boundary="--11"----11Content-Type: multipart/alternative;	boundary="--22"----22Content-Type: text/plain;        charset="us-ascii"Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitTEXT----22Content-Type: text/html;        charset="us-ascii"Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;----22------11Content-Type: image/jpg;     name="budd.jpg"Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ==----11--' readStream.1.

Saving attachments directly into external files while parsing a message (streams the attachment directly into a file 'my-budd.jpg' in the current directory; the corresponding message part's source becomes an external stream on that file)	input := 'From: zz@holcim.comContent-Type: multipart/related;	boundary="--11"----11Content-Type: image/jpg; name="budd.jpg"Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="budd.jpg"Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ==----11--' readStream.	[	message := MailBuildHandler new				saveAttachmentsAsFiles: true;				removeContentTransferEncoding: true;				readFrom: input. 	] 		on: AttachmentFilename		do:  [ :ex | ex resume: 'my-', ex filename asFilename tail ].5. 	Handling unsupported characters in header fileds (Cincom™.txt)When the parsing machinery encounters a character that is not supported by current header field encoding (ISO-8859-1 by default) an UnsupportedCharacterReplacement notification is signaled. A handler for this notification can resume it with arbitrary replacement character, otherwise the character will be replaced with ASCII NUL character (code 0) by default. 	string :='Date: Mon, 19 May 2003 13:52:36 +0200To: test &lt;test.dst.1@pb.here&gt;Subject: Test MessageContent-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary="----------lNT1O53UKi8GkFrVZPze3O"------------lNT1O53UKi8GkFrVZPze3OContent-Disposition: attachment; filename="Cincom™.txt"Content-Type: application/octet-stream; name="Cincom™.txt"Content-Transfer-Encoding: Base64UPjtbGmaIJ5sdZ1vdehr/SBr+fIg+nDsbCDv4WJlbHNr6SDzZHkuIA0KUNjNTEmKII5MVY1PVchL3SBL2dIg2lDMTCDPwUJFTFNLySDTRFkuIA==------------lNT1O53UKi8GkFrVZPze3O--'.	[	MimeBuildHandler new			removeContentTransferEncoding: true;			readFrom: string readStream. 	]	on: UnsupportedCharacterReplacement 		do: [ :ex | ex resume: $_  ].</body></comment><class><name>MailFileReader</name><environment>Net</environment><super>Net.MailBuildHandler</super><private>false</private><indexed-type>none</indexed-type><inst-vars></inst-vars><class-inst-vars></class-inst-vars><imports></imports><category>Net-MIME-Support</category><attributes><package>Mail</package></attributes></class><comment><class-id>Net.MailFileReader</class-id><body>This is a special purpose parser handler aimed at reading messages from mail archives stored in external files, like the unix mbox files. The primary difference with the other handlers is that the original input stream is expected to be permanent, positionable stream so instead of copying the entire content of the message out of the input stream, the message is built in such a way that the source streams of its individual parts are just StreamSegments pointing back to the original input stream. The fundamental assumption is that the external archive will continue being available for the lifetime of the message objects and therefore there's no reason to waste space by copying its contents. It's quite common that external mail files contain a number of messages. Consequently there are potentially many message objects read from and therefore sharing the same input stream. The application is responsible for closing the input stream when it is done with the messages read from it. Note that accessing source streams of such message will usually reopen the input stream automatically if it is closed, so it is usually pointless to close the input stream right after a message is read. Generally the application will need close the input streams it used when exiting.Due to the specialized nature of messages built by this class there are some differences that need to be considered. The byteSources of message bodies is always a binary stream on a segment of the original mail file. Since there is potentially a number of messages sharing the original input stream, the byteSources are strictly kept in binary mode to prevent conflicting expectations of different body parts or messages. Consequently the sources of message bodies are stacks of streams that completely decode the body from its stored form. There is no need to explicitly remove transfer encoding on messages built by this class. The message #contents automatically returns a completely decoded body value.	Examples1.

A mail message has text and zero or more attachments. Mail message's text can have a number of different representations as follows:	Simple messageThis message has no attachments and its contents is text of the message. The message should have text content type ('text/*'); its subtype defines text formatting ('plain', 'rtf', 'html').	Multipart messageThis message uses multipart content type ('multipart/*'). Multipart message contains zero or more parts. One of the subparts is the text part. It may be simple or multipart/alternative part allowing to contain several alternative representations of the message text. This is done by enclosing all alternative representations into one multipart/alternative part.  Mail message itself may be multipart/alternative. In this case the message has no attachments, just alternative representations of its text. Otherwise, the top-level message uses content-type multipart/mixed. The text part is the first part of this message.This class adds methods to access the message text (part) and to  perform common transformations (add/remove attachment, replace message text, mutate message from multipart into single part and vice versa) in such a way to preserve message structural consistency. This includes changing and/or mutating message body, fields and contentsMessage text-related methods allow to specify a list of preferences. This is useful when client can display text in more than one format. Preferences can be specified as array or desired formats i.e. #('html' 'plain' '*'). The default is #('plain' '*') The implementation of the part manipulation methods is often not in this class itself, but are actually performed by an associated 'bot' -- a MailMessageBot</body></comment><class><name>MailMessageBot</name><environment>Net</environment><super>Net.MimeEntityBot</super><private>false</private><indexed-type>none</indexed-type><inst-vars></inst-vars><class-inst-vars></class-inst-vars><imports></imports><category>Net-MIME-Support</category><attributes><package>Mail</package></attributes></class><comment><class-id>Net.MailMessageBot</class-id><body>This class provides a 'robot' to perform common tasks on mail messages.

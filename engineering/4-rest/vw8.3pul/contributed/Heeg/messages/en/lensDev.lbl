A canvas defines the layout and components that will be visible on a window while accessing the database. The name of the Data Form class, which will already have been specified, is shown at the top of the dialog. 1.	Enter the name of the canvas to be generated.  By default, the canvas is saved under the canvas name windowSpec but any other name can be used.  If a canvas already exists with the same name, it is overwritten and previous work may be lost.  In this case, a warning dialog will appear that can be used to cancel generation.  The Canvas Composer (see the VisualWorks Launcher Database menubar item) can be used to generate an initial canvas under a different canvas name.2.	Specify the Edit Polity.  This controls whether and how the resulting data form can be edited. The Never option will disable editing of all fields on a canvas. The When Told option starts editing of a row after an Edit button has been clicked or when an Edit checkbox has been checked. The When Touched option starts editing of a row when any field is selected by the user.3.	Specify the Template to be used for generating the canvas; this defines the appearance and controls the generated canvas will have. Each template gives a generated canvas a different set of control buttons and different layout of fields. The resulting canvas can be edited using VisualWorks painting tools.  Generally, the canvas will open automatically for touch-up as soon as this dialog terminates.  Later, the same canvas can be edited again by selecting the Data Form class and canvas name in the Resource Finder, and pressing the Edit button.  Templates can be easily added to and removed from the system, but the following templates are standard equipment:	Multiple Row Editor		A form-based presentation with transport and editing controls (for editing a set of rows)	Multiple Row Viewer		A read-only form-based presentation with transport controls only (for displaying a set of rows)	Row Editor		A form-based presentation with editing controls only (for editing a single row)	Row Viewer		A read-only form-based presentation (for displaying a single row)	Tabular Editor		A tabular display with editing controls (for editing a set of rows)	Tabular Viewer		A read-only tabular display (for displaying a set of rows)4.	Specify the Entity fields to be included in the generated canvas, by selecting in the entity view at the bottom of the Canvas Composer. The user can navigate the entity view by clicking on any black arrow to expand the graph in the direction of the arrow. Clicking on any hollow arrow will shrink the graph. To select all the fields for a given entity, select the check box to the right of the entity name.5.

In these cases, the type of the class to be created can depend on the type of resource to be installed.1.	Enter the name and category for the new application class.  A category is a subdivision of the classes in the system. It affects only how the new class will be presented in browsers.  For database applications, the default category is the category of the data model you worked with most recently.  The first letter of the class name will become capitalized, even if it is entered in lower case.2.	Use the ''Define As'' radio buttons to select the type of class to be created.  If the type of the class is already determined, some or all of these buttons may be disabled.  In this step, you are determining the superclass of the new application class.  There are four basic kinds:	Dialog		A window that will be used as a simple dialog	Application		A persistent window for an ordinary application	Data Form		A component that presents database objects	Main Application		A ''top level'' database application that holds a data model and uses Data Forms as its componentsThe application''s superclass is based on these choices, but for each general type you can also specify the specific superclass to be used, by entering its name.3.	If the class is either a Database Application or a Data Form, select the Data Model.  By default, the last Data Model you worked with is displayed.  To specify a different Data Model, use the Browse button to select from among all the Data Models currently installed in the system.4.	If the class is a Database Application, select the row Locking Policy to be used5.	If the class is a Data Form, select the Entities to be included in each row (what entities are available depends on the Data Model you selected).  The available entities are on a menu under the Add Entity menu button.  One generally selects only a single entity, unless the Data Form is intended to handle the result of a joined query.6.

When you forget to "install" a changed canvas before previewing, a warning dialog asks whether you want to "install" first.  To arrange for a changed canvas to be automatically reinstalled during "preview" operations, turn on the "Install for Preview" settings.Preview File Location specifies the directory and filename you want to use for preview operations. The "preview" operation generates HTML for the canvas you are painting and saves it to the specified location. You may then open the file with a web browser and preview what the canvas will look like when it''s displayed by the browser. "Delete all files in directory" will remove all the files in this preview directory. This may be necessary as files will accumulate if you use images (internally cached or externally retrieved images) on the canvas. A unique file will be generated for each image. 'GenKey7 = 'Serve Inline Web ImagesThere are three mechanisms for serving images for the Web: True GIFs (with LZW compression)	This setting uses the GIF LZW compression algorithm covered by Unisys Patent No. 4,588,302.  By using the software providing GIF (LZW) compression/decompression capability, you agree to comply with the Software License Agreement for the VisualWave GIF Enhancement as provided on hardcopy in the VisualWave product package.Uncompressed GIF-Compatible ("GUF")		This setting uses an uncompressed GIF-compatible format that does not require the licensing of the GIF LZW compression algorithm from Unisys. These bitmaps render properly in well-implemented GIF viewers (including almost all web browsers) but are typically anywhere from 2 to 20 times as large as compressed GIFs.Use Java Renderer	This setting will inline a special Java applet for rendering graphic images.'GenKey9 = 'Please fill in the name of the preview file.'httpwwwcincomsmalltalkcom = 'http://www.cincomsmalltalk.com'IBM = 'IBM'IEHTMLLook = 'IE HTML Look'IllegalFileName = ' Illegal file name: \  'invalidComponent = 'invalid component'isAlsoNamed = 'is also named:'Large = 'Large'LoadWhichSetOfBookmarks = 'Load which set of bookmarks'Menu = 'Menu'NameForBookmarks = 'Name for Bookmarks'nBookmark1snnotFound = '<n>Bookmark: <1s><n>not found'needToUpdateToNewTools = 'need to update to new tools'NeedToUpdateToNewTools = ' need to update to new tools'New = 'New'no = 'no'Nobody = 'Nobody'NoMatchingFiles = 'No matching files'OK = 'OK'Old = 'Old'Old1s = 'Old-<1s>'Perm = 'Perm'SaveBookmarksAs = 'Save bookmarks as ...'SelectAnURL = 'Select an URL'shouldntBeHere = 'shouldn''t be here'Stack = 'Stack'subCanvas1pNotFound = 'sub canvas <1p> not found!'text1pNotFound = 'text:  <1p> not found!'tooManyArguments = 'too many arguments'TryAgain = 'Try again'UnknownFileFormat = 'Unknown file format'visualNotFound = 'visual not found'WaveRules = 'Wave Rules'x1s = '/<1s>'x1s2s = '<1s> <2s>'x1s2s3s = '<1s>(<2s>)%>%><3s>'x1sbmk = '<1s>.bmk'x1sCanNotBeWrittenTo = '"<1s>" can not be written to.'yes = 'yes'

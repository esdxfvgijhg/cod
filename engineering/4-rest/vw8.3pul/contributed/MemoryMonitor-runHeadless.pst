In order to produce logs headlessly with the MemoryMonitor, you still need to tell the MemoryMonitor class to start running headless after loading the MemoryMonitor parcel.  Loading this parcel as well has that effect.  Note, though, that there is currently no way to stop the logging because it is assumed the application image will be stopped after the information is collected.  If you need to start and stop the logging, trace the post load action in this parcel and see how the headless instance is created.  Remember the object somewhere, and when you are done send it the message #terminateMonitoringActivities.  Note that, since taking this approach seems to imply some access to the development environment, you can probably more tightly integrate the headless logging functionality into your application instead of using this parcel.DbIdentifier: bear73DbTrace: 443220DbUsername: nrossDbVersion: 1.4DevelopmentPrerequisites: #(#(#any 'MemoryMonitor' ''))PackageName: MemoryMonitor-runHeadlessParcel: #('MemoryMonitor-runHeadless')ParcelName: MemoryMonitor-runHeadlessPrerequisiteDescriptions: #(#(#name 'MemoryMonitor' #componentType #package))PrerequisiteParcels: #(#('MemoryMonitor' ''))PrintStringCache: (1.4,nross)Version: 1.4Post-Load Block: 	[:package | Refactory.MemoryMonitorNamespace.MemoryMonitor runHeadless]Date: 10:40:54 AM July 25, 2014 --><time-stamp>From VisualWorksÂ®, Pre-Release 8.0 (jul14.3) of July 25, 2014 on July 25, 2014 at 10:40:54 AM</time-stamp><do-it>(Dialog confirm: 'You are filing-in a Parcel source file!\\While this is possible it will not have\the same effect as loading the parcel.\None of the Parcel''s prerequisites will\be loaded and none of its load actions\will be performed.\\Are you sure you want to file-in?' withCRs) ifFalse: [self error: 'Parcel file-in abandoned.

The framework UMLForSmalltalk supports building classes using all kind of UML-Links.
The framework is developed for VisualWorks, but may be usable under other dialects.

Feartures of  framework UMLForSmalltalk:

    * Supporting associations
    * Supporting aggregations
    * Supporting unidirectional links
    * Supporting bidirectional links
    * Supporting all link-cardinalites

With the framework UMLForSmalltalk hirachical structures of classes (models) can be organized by using all kind of links as described in the UML. With UMLForSmalltalk the work with complex models is much more easier !

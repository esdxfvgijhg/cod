<p>The goodie parcel <tt>ClassSelector.pcl </tt>replaces the VisualLauncher
class entry dialog for menu operation Browse->Class Named... to a class
selector dialog.&nbsp; The class selector dialog includes a list of all
classes in the image whose selection changes to best match a class entry
as it is entered.&nbsp; Classes may be selected from the list or their
partial names entered or pasted into the entry field.&nbsp; Classes of
like name that appear in separate namespaces will appear in the list in
their full name.&nbsp; The wild card character "*" may be used to reduce
the list of classes to only those that best match the entry so far.&nbsp;
Double click to select and close the dialog on a class in the list or make
a selection and press the Enter key.
<p>To see an example how the selection changes with an entry try typing
in the following strings into the class selector dialog:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Byte*Str*
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Doc*
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Data*Co*
<p>To restore the original class entry dialog simply unload the class selector
parcel <tt>ClassSelector.pcl</tt>.

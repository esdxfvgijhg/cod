It is written in Smalltalk and lives in the Smalltalk programming environment. T-Gen supports the generation of both top-down (LL) and bottom-up (LR) parsers, which will automatically generate derivation trees, abstract syntax trees, or arbitrary Smalltalk objects. The simple specification syntax and graphical user interface are intended to enhance the learning, comprehension, and usefulness of T-Gen. CURRENT STATUS:No active development, maintenance only.KNOWN PROBLEMS:NoneCHANGE HISTORY:v5.0 -  code cleanup, created Tgen namespace, factored Tgen into Core, Development (of grammars), and Testing parcelsv3.0 -  code cleanup and parcelled for easier installationv2.2.1 -  see st-www.cs.uiuc.edu/users/droberts/tgen2.2.1/tgen.html LEGAL INFORMATION The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied, with respect to thissoftware, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose.

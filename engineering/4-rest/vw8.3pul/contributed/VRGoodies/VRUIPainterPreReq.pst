The block is evaluated immediately after a parcel is unloaded or removed, consequently it cannot and should not mention any code in this Parcel. The block should be used to perform whatever clean-up actions on unload are required. post-unload blocks should only be required in unusual circumstances.  You should use class-side obsolete methods if possible.  A class is sent obsolete when it is removed from the system.  All classes defined by a parcel are removed from the system during unloading or removal of the parcel.''	[]Date: 10:09:17 am June 3, 2002 --><time-stamp>From VisualWorks®, Pre-Release 7 of June 3, 2002 on June 3, 2002 at 10:09:17 am</time-stamp><do-it>(Dialog confirm: 'You are filing-in a Parcel source file!\\While this is possible it will not have\the same effect as loading the parcel.\None of the Parcel''s prerequisites will\be loaded and none of its load actions\will be performed.\\Are you sure you want to file-in?' withCRs) ifFalse: [self error: 'Parcel file-in abandoned.

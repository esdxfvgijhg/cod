<p>This goodie contains a minimal framework for database connection pooling using VisualWorks.</p>

<p>It provides a LogicalConnection class which can be used as a connection pool. For example,
<pre>
	basicConnection = PostgreSQLEXDIConnection new
		username 'username';
		password 'password';	
		environment 'host5432_dbname'.
	connection = LogicalConnection new basicConnection.
	connection maxSessions 10.
	connection connectionTimeout 15 * 60.
</pre>
<br>
We can connect this sesssion.
<pre>
	connection connect.
</pre>
<br>
get a session to execute database commands
<pre>
	connection getSession.
</pre>
<br>
and eventually disconnect
<br>
<pre>
	connection disconnect.
</pre>
</p>
<p>Note that this currently only handles pooling of connections for read. For write acess you will need to obtain a connection with its own non-shared transactional context.</p>

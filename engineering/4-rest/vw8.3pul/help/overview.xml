		<p>The &Product; <i>Help Browser</i> provides quick online help on 
			the Smalltalk language, the development environment, the coding tools, 
			some of the basic class libraries, and add-on components.</p>
		<p>The Help topics can guide your understanding of <i>concepts</i> (e.g., 
			"how are variables scoped in Smalltalk?"), <i>tasks</i> (e.g., "how 
			do I create a class?"), as well as the <i>class library</i> ("which 
			classes are best for sorting lists?"), and <i>add-on components</i> 
			("which add-on frameworks provide support for HTTP?"). Detailed 
			descriptions of the development tools and their menus are available, 
			as are some best practices for using the &Product; environment, and 
			many code examples to illustrate use of the class library.</p>

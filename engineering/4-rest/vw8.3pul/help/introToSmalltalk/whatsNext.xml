		<body>
			<p>Now that you've learned the basics, explore Smalltalk in more depth:
				<ul>
					<li>Explore the &Product; documentation. At the least, read the 
						<xref href="./doc/WalkThrough.pdf" format="pdf" 
						scope="external"><i>Walk Through</i></xref>, 
						look at the &Product; <xref href="./doc/AppDevGuide.pdf" 
						format="pdf" scope="external"><i>Application Developer's Guide</i></xref>, 
						and the <xref href="./doc/GUIDevGuide.pdf" format="pdf" 
						scope="external"><i>GUI Developer's Guide</i></xref>.</li>
					<li>Read some of the code in the class library (but remember that although the 
						code in the image is very instructive, it is not always perfect).</li>
					<li>Create applications with your own classes.</li>
					<li>Learn about Extreme Programming (XP).</li>
				</ul></p>

			<p>When studying source code in the Browser, consider the following:
				<ul>
					<li>Take advantage of package names. If you want to know about collections, 
						then a good place to start is to browse packages in the 
						<apiname otherprops="pundle">Collections</apiname> bundle.</li>
					<li>Learn about implementors-of, senders-of, references-to, and other relationships 
						and examples. Use the options on the <uicontrol>Browse</uicontrol> menu in the Launcher 
						and similar commands in the Browser itself.</li>
					<li>Read class comments, and look at the class side for <codeph>examples</codeph> and 
						<codeph>documentation</codeph> protocols. Examples are also sometimes included as 
						comments, as in the <codeph>Dialog</codeph> class methods.</li>
					<li>Find a more experienced Smalltalker or study with a fellow student.</li>
					<li>Explore some of the resources listed in the <i>References</i> section, at the end 
						of this introduction.</li>
				</ul>

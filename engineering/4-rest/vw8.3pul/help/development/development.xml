		<title>Development Environment</title>
		<body>
			<p>&Product; is a complete Smalltalk development environment that 
				includes a rich class library and a powerful arsenal of tools.</p>
			<p>The &Product; environment is comprised of a portable Smalltalk 
				<term>virtual image</term> (usually called an <term>image file</term>), 
				that is run by a platform-specific <term>virtual machine</term>. The 
				standard distribution image of &Product; is sometimes referred to as 
				the <term>base image</term>. As you develop applications using &Product;, 
				you generally save your work in your own copies of the image file.</p>
			<p>&Product; includes a number of tools for managing the image file, 
				the user interface settings (e.g., themes, key bindings, etc.) you 
				prefer, for managing code changes, code components, and more.</p>

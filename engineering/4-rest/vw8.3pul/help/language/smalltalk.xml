<title>Smalltalk Language</title>
<body><p>Smalltalk has a simple syntax based on messages, literals, variables,
and block expressions. This simplicity makes Smalltalk very easy to learn.</p>
<p>The language includes higher-level abstractions &#x2014; classes and metaclasses &#x2014;,
which define the behavior of all objects in the Smalltalk environment.</p>
<p>&Product; complies with ANSI standards for Smalltalk syntax, but employs some 
extensions, such as name spaces.</p></body>

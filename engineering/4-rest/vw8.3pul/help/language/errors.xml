<title>Errors During Compilation</title>
<body><p>When you evaluate Smalltalk code in a Workspace or 
<uicontrol>Accept</uicontrol> a method in a browser, the Source Code
Editor may notify you of an error using red-highlighted text. The error
message appears directly beneath the line of code in which 
the error was found, and disappears automatically when the issue 
has been resolved.</p>
<p>There are only a few types of errors, most of which can be easily 
corrected.</p></body>

<body><p><indexterm>variables<indexterm>undeclared error</indexterm></indexterm><indexterm>errors<indexterm>undeclared
variable</indexterm></indexterm>If you neglect to declare a variable
in a method definition and select <uicontrol>Accept</uicontrol> to compile 
it, the Source Code Editor prompts you with a list of variable types. By 
picking an item from this list, you may declare the variable as a temporary, 
instance, shared, or name space variable. Finally, you also have the option 
to add the variable to the <uicontrol>Undeclared List</uicontrol>.</p>

<title>Locate missing source code</title>
<body><p><indexterm>missing source code</indexterm><indexterm>source
code<indexterm>missing</indexterm></indexterm>Source code is 
stored in a single <term>sources file</term> associated with 
your &Product; development image. Very rarely, if you have 
improperly moved your development image and/or sources files on 
your workstation's file system, you may receive an alert that 
source files cannot be found.</p>
<p>If you see code in the browser with a comment explaining that it
is decompiled code, <i>the system source or changes file is not
correctly identified with your image</i>.</p>
<p>To correctly identify the sources file, open the 
<xref href="st:SettingsManager openOrRaise: VisualWorksSettings" 
format="st" scope="external">Settings Tool</xref>
(select <uicontrol>System &#x2192; Settings</uicontrol> in the Launcher
window) and check that the <uicontrol>&Product; Home Directory</uicontrol> 
(on the <uicontrol>System</uicontrol> tab) is correct. If the 
missing source code error persists, it may be necessary to edit the
<uicontrol>Source &#x2192; Source Files</uicontrol> page, making
sure the prefix of the "<filepath>.sou</filepath>" file agrees 
with the name of your saved image file (e.g., <filepath>visual.im</filepath> 
expects to find sources in <filepath>visual.sou</filepath>).</p>

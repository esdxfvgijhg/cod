All rights reserved.Comment: Loads all Web Services client packages.OverviewClass WsdlClient makes it easy to use Web services defined by the WSDL protocol.WsdlClient provides the following services:	1. Given a URI, it loads an XML document that contains a WSDL schema	2. If the WSDL schema includes the schema-defined data types (<schema>), class WsdlClient creates an XML-to-Smaltalk binding element <schemaBindings>. By default, all XML complexType elements are mapped to Smalltalk Dictionary objects.	3. Creates the confing file which holds WSDL schema marshalers. 	4. Sends a SOAP request and receives a SOAP response.	5. The WSDL client uses HttpClient to a open persistent connectionUsageExecute operation: #echoString 	client := WsdlClient url: 'http://www.someserver/services'.	val := client executeSelector: #echoString args: #('ABc12')DbIdentifier: bear73DbTrace: 493899DbUsername: tkoganDbVersion: 8.3 - 0DevelopmentPrerequisites: #(#(#any 'WSDL' ''))PackageName: WebServicesClientParcel: #('WebServicesClient')ParcelName: WebServicesClientPrerequisiteDescriptions: #(#(#name 'WSDL' #componentType #bundle))PrerequisiteParcels: #(#('WSDL' ''))PrintStringCache: (8.3 - 0,tkogan)Version: 8.3 - 0Date: 2:31:39 PM April 28, 2017 --><time-stamp>From VisualWorksÂ®, Pre-Release 8.3 (apr17.3) of April 28, 2017 on April 28, 2017 at 2:31:39 PM</time-stamp><do-it>(Dialog confirm: 'You are filing-in a Parcel source file!\\While this is possible it will not have\the same effect as loading the parcel.\None of the Parcel''s prerequisites will\be loaded and none of its load actions\will be performed.\\Are you sure you want to file-in?' withCRs) ifFalse: [self error: 'Parcel file-in abandoned.

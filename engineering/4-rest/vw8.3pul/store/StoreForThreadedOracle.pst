All rights reserved.Comment: This parcel loads the prereqs required for using threaded connections to connect to Oracle Store repositories. It reuires no code of its own.  Using a threaded connection means that Store operations will only block the UI thread that initiated the operation and not the entire image. So for example if you initiate a 'compare versions' operation from a package browser, only the browser UI will be blocked, but the Launcher or other open tools will be functional. This behavior is similar to what you'd experience with Postgres Store repositories.WARNING: Note that some actions that you perform in other tools might interfere with Store operation in progress, possibly yielding inconsistent image state. Be cautious with any activities concurrent with Store operations.Store adds team development and version control tools and facilities to the VisualWorks development environment. Further information can be found in the "Source Code Management Guide" (located in the /doc subdirectory of the VisualWorks installation).DbIdentifier: bear73DbTrace: 430675DbUsername: nrossDbVersion: 8.0 - 1DevelopmentPrerequisites: #(#(#any 'StoreForOracle' '') #(#any 'OracleThapiEXDI' ''))PackageName: StoreForThreadedOracleParcel: #('StoreForThreadedOracle')ParcelName: StoreForThreadedOraclePrerequisiteParcels: #(#('StoreForOracle' '') #('OracleThapiEXDI' ''))PrintStringCache: (8.0 - 1,nross)Version: 8.0 - 1Date: 12:50:08 PM May 2, 2014 --><time-stamp>From VisualWorksÂ®, Pre-Release 8.0 (may14.1) of May 2, 2014 on May 2, 2014 at 12:50:08 PM</time-stamp><do-it>(Dialog confirm: 'You are filing-in a Parcel source file!\\While this is possible it will not have\the same effect as loading the parcel.\None of the Parcel''s prerequisites will\be loaded and none of its load actions\will be performed.\\Are you sure you want to file-in?' withCRs) ifFalse: [self error: 'Parcel file-in abandoned.

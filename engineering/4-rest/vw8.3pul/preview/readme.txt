The components currently in Beta Test are:

 - 64-bit ImageWriter
   A parcel containing support for writing 64-bit vm compatible 
   Smalltalk images, and a pre-built 64-bit image (in 
   preview/64-bit/).
   
 - Base Image
   An early version of a minimal image designed for use to 
   deploy an application only using loadable parcels (in
   preview/packaging/).
   
 - Asian Support
   Localization support and encoding for several Asian locales
   (in preview/asia/).
   
 - Cairo Graphics Support
   A binding for accessing the Cairo Graphics libraries (in

   Extensions to GLORP, such as Active Record and utilities (in 
   preview/glorp).

 - Grid
   Similar to a DataSetView, a Grid widget uses a sequencable list

   (in preview/grid/).

   EXDI, Thapi, and Store support for Cincom's Supra database 
   (in preview/database/).

 - VisualWorks Multi-version launcher
   This launcher works on Unix/Linux platforms, similar to the

This directory contains the C code for testing DLLCC for VisualWorks.

The makefiles found in src/makeplat/<platName> have a rule named, dllcc, for creating the cptst loadable library.

To build the fast version of the dllcc library:

1. create a build directory
2. create a symbolic link named 'src' linked to the vm source directory
3. create a symbolic link named 'makefile' linked to 'src/makeplat/<platName>/fast.nb.lg.makefile
4. make dllcc

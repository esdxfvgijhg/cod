NOTES ON THE BATCH FILE AND THE MIDL COMPILER.

The MIDL compiler response file adds a prefix to the name of the .H file 
to avoid a file name clash if the Visual C++ 5.0 Class Wizard
is used to generate a wrapper class for dispinterfaces from
a type library.

The Class Wizard will create <libraryName>.h and <libraryName>.cpp
files creating a subclass of COleDispatchDriver. You may change 
the files names in the Class Wizard. 

You should rename the class in the VC++ Class Wizard since it 
will clash with the definition generated by the MIDL compiler.

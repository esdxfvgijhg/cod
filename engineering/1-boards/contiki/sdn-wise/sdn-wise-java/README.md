[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sdnwiselab/sdn-wise-java.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sdnwiselab/sdn-wise-java) [![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/grade/0ff5041b31c44911b81060d17b3e6eba)](https://www.codacy.com/app/sdnwiselab/sdn-wise-java)

The stateful Software Defined Networking solution for the Internet of Things. This repository contains a Java implementation of SDN-WISE. The repository is splitted into three folders:

* core: which contains the definitions of the flowtable, the packets, and some utility classes.
* ctrl: containing a small Java control plane that can be used to manage an emulated SDN-WISE network.
* data: an emulated SDN-WISE sensor node written in Java.

### Installation

Install Java, Maven and [RXTX](http://rxtx.qbang.org/wiki/index.php/Installation). On Ubuntu: 

```
sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk maven librxtx-java  

```

Clone the GitHub repository and use Maven to build `sdn-wise-java`:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/sdnwiselab/sdn-wise-java.git
cd sdn-wise-java
mvn clean install
cd ctrl/build
java -jar sdn-wise-ctrl-X.X.X-jar-with-dependencies.jar 
```

When the network discovery is complete the SDN-WISE Java Control Plane GUI will popup. 
This GUI allows you to send a packet to a node, set/read the properties of a node, and check the content of its flowtable.

TTN and LoRaWAN
===============

The low-cost gateway can be configured to push data to TheThingsNetwork platform. Pushing to TTN is realized with the legacy UDP-based protocol between the gateway and the network server as initially defined by Semtech. `CloudTTN.py` is a Python script based on the Pycom NanoGateway Python script to interact with the TTN platform. It is possible to only use encapsulated encrypted mode packet and still be able to push data to TTN as the encapsulated encrypted payload is formatted like a LoRaWAN packet. It is of course also possible to use the native LoRaWAN mode to both push to TTN and advertise the gateway as a single channel LoRaWAN-limited gateway on TTN (meaning that the low-cost gateway can receive and push data from other LoRaWAN devices - sending on the same LoRa setting BW, SF and frequency - that are registered on TTN).

The regular gateway id normally contains the 6 bytes of the eth0 MAC address, i.e. 0000B827EBD1B236. The gateway id for TTN will then be defined as B827EBFFFFD1B236. Then, to configure the TTN support, you need to proceed as follows:

- you need to create an account on TTN. Follow tutorials on Internet. A nice tutorial can be found on [https://medium.com/kkbankol-events/tutorial-build-a-open-source-smart-city-based-on-lora-7ca76b9a098](https://medium.com/kkbankol-events/tutorial-build-a-open-source-smart-city-based-on-lora-7ca76b9a098) but there are others

- you need to register your gateway on TTN first (using the gateway TTN id, B827EBFFFFD1B236 for instance). Follow tutorials on Internet
	- it is good to mention that it is a low-cost single channel gateway and also indicating the listening frequency
	- see for instance our test gateway: https://console.thethingsnetwork.org/gateways/eui-b827ebffffd1b236
	
- you need to create an application on TTN. Follow tutorials on Internet

- you need to create a device on TTN in ABP mode. Follow tutorials on Internet

- get the DevAddr, the Network Session Key and the App Session Key from the TTN console to fill-in the Arduino example `Arduino_LoRa_temp` to create a device capable of forging encrypted packet.

- if you want to enable the native LORAWAN mode where the device can communicate to a LoRaWAN gateway (and the low-cost gateway), you have to use native LoRaWAN by uncommenting in `Arduino_LoRa_temp` both `#define WITH_AES` and `#define LORAWAN`. See this [README](https://github.com/CongducPham/LowCostLoRaGw/tree/master/Arduino#lorawan-example-and-support) in the Arduino folder. By default, the device will use SF12BW125 on 868.1MHz.

- `Arduino_LoRa_LMIC_ABP_BASIC` is an example that uses the Arduino LMIC port and is provided as an example of a full LoRaWAN stack that can communicate with our low-cost gateway as well

- For the gateway to handle native LoRaWAN packet and push it to TTN, proceed as follows:
	- set `["radio_conf"]["mode"]` to 11 in `gateway_conf.json` to configure for native LoRaWAN reception on single channel
	- set `["gateway_conf"]["raw"]` to true in `gateway_conf.json` 
	- set `["gateway_conf"]["aes"]` to false as encrypted data will be pushed to TTN
	- gateway will be configured with BW=125MHz, CR=4/5, SF=12 by default
	- the frequency is set by default to 868.1MHz for BAND868, 923.2MHz for BAND900 and 433.175 for BAND433 
	- `python CloudTTN.py` has been be added in the LoRaWAN encrypted cloud section of `clouds.json`. Enable it by setting `"enabled"` to `true`

	```
		"lorawan_encrypted_clouds" : [
			{	
				"name":"TheThingsNetwork cloud",
				"script":"python CloudTTN.py",
				"type":"TTN",			
				"enabled":false			
			},	
			...	
		]
	```	

- if you want to use the encapsulated encrypted mode, uncomment in `Arduino_LoRa_temp` both `#define WITH_AES` and `#define EXTDEVADDR` to enable encapsulated encrypted mode. Communication between the device and the gateway uses our header where the addressing still use the 1-byte address (the LoRaWAN-like packet is encapsulated in our packet). In the encapsulated mode, the device can only communicate to our gateway, not to a LoRaWAN gateway. However, you have to indicate the 4-byte DevAddr to make the link with the device declared on the TTN console. 

```
	///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
	// LORAWAN OR EXTENDED DEVICE ADDRESS FOR LORAWAN CLOUD
	#if defined LORAWAN || defined EXTDEVADDR
	///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
	//ENTER HERE your Device Address from the TTN device info (same order, i.e. msb). Example for 0x12345678
	unsigned char DevAddr[4] = { 0x12, 0x34, 0x56, 0x78 };
	///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
```

- For the gateway to handle encapsulated encrypted packet and push it to TTN, proceed as follows:
	- set `["gateway_conf"]["raw"]` to true in `gateway_conf.json` 
	- set `["gateway_conf"]["aes"]` to false as encrypted data will be pushed to TTN
	- `python CloudTTN.py` has been be added in the encrypted cloud section of `clouds.json`. Enable it by setting `"enabled"` to `true`
	```	
		"encrypted_clouds" : [
			{	
				"name":"TheThingsNetwork cloud",
				"script":"python CloudTTN.py",
				"type":"TTN",			
				"enabled":false			
			},	
			...	
		]	
	```

- if `["radio_conf"]["mode"]` is 11 **AND** `["status_conf"]["ttn_status"]` is true then `scripts/ttn/ttn_stats.py` will be called periodically by the `post_status_processing_gw.py` status loop (which is called by `post-processing_gw.py`) to report the gateway status on TTN. You can therefore always leave `["status_conf"]["ttn_status"]` to true and status will be reported to TTN only when you are using LoRaWAN mode, i.e. `["radio_conf"]["mode"]` is 11.


In both cases, native LoRaWAN and encapsulated encrypted, once everything is set up, go to your TTN console and search for your device. Go to the `Data` tab to see your packets arriving on TTN.

Enjoy!
